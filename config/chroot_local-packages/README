This directory allows to put binary packages that will be installed in the
live system.

It is only meant for quick tests, and contributors who don't have write access
to the official Git repository. Packages should not be commited to the
official Git repository. Experience has shown that it does not scale.

See <https://tails.boum.org/contribute/APT_repository/> for informations on
how to use Tails APT repository.
