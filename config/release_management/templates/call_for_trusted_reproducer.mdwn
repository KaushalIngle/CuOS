Subject: Looking for a Trusted Reproducer for Tails {{version}}

Hi!

Can you be the Trusted Reproducer for Tails {{version}}?

Your job will be to reproduce the ISO and USB images for the RC (if applicable)
and final release within 72 hours after the RM (yours truly) has unplugged
their smartcard.

If you volunteer, you must immediately read the "Preparation" section of
the instructions:

Thank you for considering,
cheers!
