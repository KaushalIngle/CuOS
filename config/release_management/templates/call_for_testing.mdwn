# Get Tails {{version}}

## To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your persistent storage

- Automatic upgrades are available from 4.2 or later to {{version}}.

  To do an automatic upgrade to Tails {{version}}:

  1. Start Tails 4.2 or later and
     [[set an administration password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].
  
  1. Run this command in a *Terminal*:
  
         echo TAILS_CHANNEL=\"alpha\" | sudo tee -a /etc/os-release && \
              tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper
  
     Enter the administration password when asked for the "password
     for amnesia".
  
  1. After the upgrade is applied, restart Tails and choose
     **Applications&nbsp;▸ Tails&nbsp;▸ About Tails**
     to verify that you are running Tails {{version}}.

- If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an
  automatic upgrade, please try to do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade/#manual]].
