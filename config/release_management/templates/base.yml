# Common rules
# ============
#
#  - Version numbers must be double-quoted.
#
# the version you're preparing (see [[contribute/release_schedule#versioning]]),
version: "FIXME"
# the last released version (which could be a release candidate, in
# case you're preparing a major release)
previous_version: "FIXME"
# the current stable release of Tails. This will be the same as
# `previous_version` except when preparing a major release.
previous_stable_version: "FIXME"
# set to the version number of the next *major* Tails release; if
# you're preparing a RC for a major release, use that major release;
# otherwise, use whatever the next planned major release is
next_planned_major_version: "FIXME"
# if you're preparing the RC for a major release, set this to the
# version number of the second next *major* Tails release; e.g. if
# preparing the RC for the 3.9 major release, then set this to 3.12
# (3.9 is the next major release, 3.10 and 3.11 are bugfix releases,
# 3.12 is a major release).
second_next_planned_major_version: "FIXME"
# set to the version number of the next scheduled *bugfix* Tails
# release
next_planned_bugfix_version: "FIXME"
# use whichever is the next scheduled release among
# `$NEXT_PLANNED_BUGFIX_VERSION` and `$NEXT_PLANNED_MAJOR_VERSION`
next_planned_version: "FIXME"
# set to the version number we'll give to the next emergency release
# if we have to put one out
next_potential_emergency_version: "FIXME"
# if `$NEXT_PLANNED_BUGFIX_VERSION` is the next scheduled release, use
# it; otherwise, use `$NEXT_POTENTIAL_EMERGENCY_VERSION`
next_stable_changelog_version: "FIXME"
# the date when you plan to publish this release, in the format
# `YYYY-MM-DD`, double quoted; if preparing a non-final release,
# use the release date for that _non-final_ release,
# not for the corresponding final release.
release_date: "FIXME"
# set to 1 if preparing a major release or a release candidate for a
# major release, to 0 otherwise
major_release: FIXME
# either 'alpha' (for RC:s) or 'stable' (for actual releases)
