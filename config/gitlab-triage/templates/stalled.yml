              Thanks for having started to work on a Tails issue! This is an
              automated triaging system that intends to avoid situations where
              inaccurate metadata ends up causing delays in completion
              of issues.

              There is at least one issue in a 'Doing' state assigned to you
              that has not been updated since more than 3 months. Please, make
              sure to update such issues in order to:

              - better reflect your plans regarding current and further work in
                each issue
              - avoid an unsustainable level of work-in-progress for yourself
              - encourage team work and increase the chances
                that someone finishes the work

              Below, there's a section titled with your GitLab username, that
              lists the issues assigned to you, in 'Doing' state, that were not
              updated since more than 3 months.

              For each such issue, you have a few options, such as:

              - Unassign yourself. That's fine. If it really matters, someone
                else, possibly you, may pick it up later.

                Then, if the issue is relevant for a Tails team, bring it to
                their attention; else, forget it and take care of yourself :)


              - If you think you can realistically come back to it and finish
                the work in the next months, say so on the issue, for example
                by commenting about your planned time frame, replacing the
                "Doing" label with "To Do", and setting a suitable milestone.

                This will communicate your plans to the rest of the project and
                ensure the task pops up on your radar at a suitable time.

                Of course, you can still realize later that it is not going to
                work as planned, and revisit today's choice.

              Cheers,

              and asking you the above questions on each such issue

              inaccurate metadata ends up causing delays in completion

              There is at least one issue in a 'Needs Validation' state assigned
              to you that has not been updated since more than 45 days. Please,
              make sure to update such issues in order to:

              that were not updated since more than 45 days.

              For each such issue, you have a few options, such as:

              - If you are the author of the work that needs validation: try to
                find someone who can complete the review in a timely manner.
              - Else, if you are the reviewer, then you are currently the one
                person responsible for the work of someone else becoming
                effective or not. Because of that, please either:
                - unassign yourself to make it clear that someone else can
                  handle it, or
                - coordinate with the author of the work and organize yourself
                  to commit with a certain time frame for handling the review.
