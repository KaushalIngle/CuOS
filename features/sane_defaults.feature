Feature: Tails has a sane default configuration

  Scenario: The live user is setup correctly
    Given I have started Tails from DVD without network and logged in
    Then the live user has been setup by live-boot
    And the live user is a member of only its own group and "cdrom dialout floppy video plugdev netdev scanner lp lpadmin"
    And the live user owns its home directory which has strict permissions

  Scenario: No unexpected network services
    Given I have started Tails from DVD without network and logged in
    When the network is plugged
    And Tor is ready
    Then no unexpected services are listening for network connections
