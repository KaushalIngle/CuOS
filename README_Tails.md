- Tails uses the Tor network to protect your privacy online and help you avoid censorship. Enjoy the Internet like it should be.
- Shut down the computer and start on your Tails USB stick instead of starting on Windows, macOS, or Linux. Tails leaves no trace on the computer when shut down.
- Tails includes a selection of applications to work on sensitive documents and communicate securely. Everything in Tails is ready-to-use and has safe defaults.
- You can download Tails for free and independent security researchers can verify our work. Tails is based on Debian GNU/Linux.
