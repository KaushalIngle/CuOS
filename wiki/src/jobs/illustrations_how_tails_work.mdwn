Details
=======

### Scope

This work is part of a larger effort to improve the description and
explanation of Tails, adjust the voice and tone of the homepage, and
implement a newly developed brand identity.

The contractor will create illustrations to aid in communicating:

- On the homepage: what is Tails and what are its main benefits

  6 small illustrations or icons, around 200px.

- On the 'How Tails works' page: the main properties and features of
  Tails

  10 medium-size illustrations, around 400px.

The contractor will work as a team with the Tails UX designer:

- The contractor will be responsible for all the illustration work.
- The Tails UX designer will be responsible for the structure, text, and
  integration on the website.

### Target audience

Activists, journalists, people who are being surveilled or censored.

People learning about Tails for the first time.

People who have to explain Tails to others, for example, digital
security trainers.

Our target audience is exemplified by our [[personas|contribute/personas]].

### Proposed process

1. Mockups

   - The contractor and the UX designer work together to ideate and
     create initial mockups for each illustration.

1. Usability testing of the content

   - The UX designer integrates the initial mockups into the draft
     content.

   - The text and illustrations is tested with a few potential users
     using the [think aloud protocol](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/).

     The contractor is encouraged to participate in the tests if they
     have experience or interest in usability testing.

   - Mockups might be refined as needed during the tests.

1. Design & illustration

   - Full illustration (16 images)

1. Revisions

   - 1 round of revision, based on feedback from the Tails community.

### Proposed timeline

Final delivery: January 2020 or earlier

- Week 1: In-person or remote sprint
  - Ideation and initial mockups
  - Usability testing and refined mockups

- Week 2-3: Full illustration

- Week 4-5: Feedback

- Week 6-7: Final illustrations delivered

### Licensing

All work will be published under the
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.

The contractor may retain copyright and will be credited on our [[license
page|doc/about/license]].

### Deliverables

Vector graphics are preferred as they will make the work easier to reuse
and adapt in the future. Raster graphics might be considered if well
justified.

Source documents compatible with Free Software tools will be provided as
deliverables:

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for vector graphics
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for raster graphics

The contractor may work with non-Free Software tools until delivery.
Only the source documents in the final delivery must be compatible with
Free Software tools.

For example, in the case of vector graphics deliverables, the contractor
may work with Adobe Illustrator but must deliver working documents in
SVG format with all the objects and features compatible with the open
SVG standard.

### Budget

Billable hours paid up to 2 500€, including meetings.

Design considerations
=====================

### Brand guidelines

See the brand attributes in our [[mission and values|contribute/mission]].

### Tone

When using Tails, people trade off bits of convenience for some extra
security. They might have very little time, be under stress, or physical
threats.

We take the safety of our users very seriously and we speak to them in a
confident and reassuring way without being lighthearted or frivolous.

Our style inspires trust but doesn't sound distant. Even though we
address serious issues, we are always empathetic and encouraging.

To be accessible to our diverse and global audience, we value clarity
and sincerity above all. We provide state-of-the-art tools without
over-promising or sounding elitist.

### Visual style

Tails doesn't have a visual style guide yet and the work on this
contract will be some of the first professional visual design work done for
Tails.

The contractor will have to propose a visual style that matches our
brand guidelines and tone without being able to refer to more detailed
visual guidelines.

The visual style proposed by the contractor must be easily adoptable and
reusable for future work.

### Color scheme

The illustrations must be compatible with our brand colors:

<style>
.brand-color {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  padding: 1em;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>

<span class="brand-color" style="background-color: #56347c; color: white;">#56347c</span>

<span class="brand-color" style="background-color: #53b351;">#53b351</span>

### Inspiration

- Our personas: how we think our target audience looks like
- Boot menu animation: other visuals on our website
- DuckDuckGo [App](https://duckduckgo.com/app) and [About](https://duckduckgo.com/about): outdoors to illustrate privacy and empowerment
- [TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/): explain a product using a nature-related theme
- [Google Doogle with bears](https://www.google.com/doodles/grandfathers-day-2019-poland): encouraging
- [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/product-tours): sketchy but serious

Design concept
==============

### Metaphor: Tails as a tent

<table>
<tr><th>Property of Tails</th><th>Property of tents and hiking in the outdoors</th></tr>
<tr><td>Portable</td><td>Tents are portable and can be used anywhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Avoid surveillance</td><td>Tents gives you a private space in a public environment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Amnesia</td><td>When you set up your tent, it always starts empty, from a clean state. When you tear it down, it is empty.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Persistence</td><td>You can store your personal stuff in your backpack and unpack it in your tent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Anonymity</td><td>Nobody know who you are when you are in your tent. Many tents look alike, making you anonymous.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leave no trace</td><td>When you pack up your tent, you leave no trace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Toolbox</td><td>You carry all you need in your backpack. Tails is like a Swiss Army knife</td></tr>
<tr><td>Avoid censorship</td><td>When walking in the outdoors, you can go anywhere, without censorship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Avoid tracking</td><td>When walking in the outdoors, you leave no trace.</td></tr>
<tr><td>No virus</td><td>Tents protect you from nuisances: mosquitoes, rain, wind, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>No ads</td><td>When going in the outdoors, you leave pollution and noise behind.</td></tr>
</table>

### Images from workshop

These are images that Tails community members drew at a visual identity
workshop. We've included them here to show how the Tails community
thinks about the tent metaphor – they’re not meant to be exactly copied.
