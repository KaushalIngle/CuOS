[[!meta title="Accessibility"]]

Tails and the GNOME desktop include assistive technologies to support users
with various impairments and special needs, and to interact with common
assistive devices.

[[!toc]]

Universal access menu
=====================

You can activate most of these technologies from the universal access menu (the
[[!img lib/preferences-desktop-accessibility.png alt="Universal Access" class="symbolic" link="no"]]
icon which looks like a person) in the top bar:

[[!img desktop/accessibility.png link="no"
alt="Universal Access menu with the following options (disabled
by default): High Contrast, Zoom, Large Text, Screen Reader, Screen Keyboard,
Visual Alters, Sticky Keys, Slow Keys, Bounce Keys, and Mouse Keys"]]

These technologies are documented in more details in the
[GNOME universal access documentation](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/a11y.html).
