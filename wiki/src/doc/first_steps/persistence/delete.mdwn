<!-- We should get rid of this warning once we have
     #8436 (Wipe the LUKS header when deleting a persistent volume). -->

<p>This technique is fast but might not prevent a strong attacker from
recovering files from an old Persistent Storage using advanced [[data
recovery techniques|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion#why]].</p>

<p>To securely delete the Persistent Storage, you have to [[securely
delete the entire USB stick|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion#erase-device]],
which is a much slower operation.</p>
