Similar problems might have been reported already for your computer model
in our [[list of known issues about Tails not starting at all|support/known_issues#pc-not-at-all]].

<h2 id="bios-settings">Edit the BIOS or UEFI settings (advanced users)</h2>

To learn how to edit the BIOS or UEFI settings, search for the user manual of
the computer on the support website of the manufacturer.

<div class="caution">

<p>Take note of the changes that you apply to the BIOS or UEFI settings. That way, you
can revert the changes if they prevent the computer from starting on its usual
operating system.</p>

</div>

In the BIOS or UEFI settings, try to apply the following changes:

- Make sure that the Boot Menu key is enabled, in your BIOS or UEFI options.
  This option might be called **Boot Device List** or something similar,
  depending on the computer.

- Edit the **Boot Order**. You might see an entry for **Removable devices**
  or **USB media**. Move this entry to the top of the list to force the computer
  to start from the USB stick before starting from the internal hard disk.

- Disable **Fast Boot**.

- Enable **CSM Boot**.

- Enable **Legacy Boot**, in addition to UEFI.
  The computer might not start anymore on its regular operating system
  if you disable UEFI completely or if you only enable Legacy boot.

- Try to upgrade the BIOS or UEFI. To do so, refer to the support website of
  the computer manufacturer.
