"Every network interface — wired or Wi-Fi — has a [[!wikipedia MAC address]], "
"which is a serial number assigned to each interface at the factory by the "
"vendor. MAC addresses are used on the local network to identify the "
"communications of each network interface."

#. type: Plain text

"While your IP address identifies where you are on the Internet, your MAC "
"address identifies which device you are using on the local network. MAC "
"addresses are only useful on the local network and are not sent over the "

"Having such a unique identifier used on the local network can harm your "
"privacy.  Here are two examples:"

msgid ""
"1. If you use your laptop to connect to several Wi-Fi networks, the\n"
"same MAC address of your Wi-Fi interface is used on all those local networks. Someone\n"
"observing those networks can recognize your MAC address and **track your\n"
"geographical location**.\n"

"1. Unless you choose to [[hide that you are connecting to the Tor\n"

"a Tor user**.\n"

"When MAC address anonymization is enabled, Tails temporarily changes the MAC "

"network."

"MAC address anonymization is enabled by default in Tails because it is "

"However, as [[discussed above|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/"
