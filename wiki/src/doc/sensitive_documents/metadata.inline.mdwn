<div class="caution">

<p>Most files contain metadata, which is information used to describe,
identify, categorize, and sort files. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cameras record data about when and where a picture was taken and what
camera was used.</li>
<li>Office documents automatically add author
and company information to texts and spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use [[<i>mat2</i>|doc/sensitive_documents/metadata]] to
clean metadata from your files before publishing or sharing them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <span class="application">Files</span> browser.</li>
<li>Navigate to the folder containing the files that you want to remove
   metadata from.</li>
<li>Select the files that you want to remove metadata from.</li>
<li>Right-click (on Mac, click with two fingers) on the files and choose
<strong>Remove metadata</strong>.</li>
</ol>
