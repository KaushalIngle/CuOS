To uninstall Tails from a USB stick, and use it for something else, you have to
reset it.

**The content of the USB stick will be lost in the operation,** but an attacker
might still be able to tell that Tails was installed on that USB stick using
[[data recovery techniques|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]] unless you
[[securely clean all the available disk space|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion#usb_and_ssd]]
afterwards.
