[[!meta title="Chatting with Pidgin and OTR"]]

For chatting and instant messaging, Tails includes the <span class="application">[Pidgin Instant
Messenger](https://pidgin.im/)</span>.

<div class="note">

<p><a href="https://dino.im/"><i>Dino</i></a> is
being considered as an option to replace <i>Pidgin</i>
in Tails.</p>

<p>You can already try using <i>Dino</i> in Tails. See our
documentation on [[chatting with <i>Dino</i> and OMEMO|doc/advanced_topics/dino]].</p>

</div>

You can use it to connect to [[!wikipedia Internet_Relay_Chat]] or [[!wikipedia XMPP]]
(also known as Jabber) servers, and have several accounts connected at
the same time.

To start <span class="application">Pidgin</span> choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Internet</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Pidgin Instant Messenger</span>
</span> or click on the <span class="application">Pidgin</span> icon in
the [[<span class="guilabel">Favorites</span> submenu|doc/first_steps/desktop#favorites]].

For more detailed documentation refer to the [official <span
class="application">Pidgin</span> user
guide](https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Pidgin).

<span class="application">Off-the-record</span> (<span class="application">OTR</span>) encryption
=================================================================================================

As explained on its [official page](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/),
<span class="application">Off-the-Record</span> messaging allows you to
have private conversations over instant messaging by providing:

- **Encryption**<br />
    No one else can read your instant messages.
- **Authentication**<br />
    You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
- **Deniability**<br />
    The messages you send do not have digital signatures
    that are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after
    a conversation to make them look like they came from you.
    However, during a conversation, your correspondent is assured
    the messages are authentic and unmodified.
- **Perfect forward secrecy**<br />
    If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation is compromised.

<div class="caution">

<p><strong>OTR is deactivated by default</strong>, and your conversations are
not private.</p>

</div>

<div class="caution">

<p><strong>File transfers are not encrypted by OTR.</strong> OTR only encrypts conversations.</p>

</div>

<div class="tip">

To store your OTR keys and preferences across separate working sessions,
you can turn on the [[Pidgin|doc/first_steps/persistence#pidgin]]
feature of the Persistent Storage.

</div>

<div class="bug">

In a private OTR conversation over IRC, <strong>a message sent using the
<code>/me</code> command is not encrypted</strong>. The person receiving
the message is notified by a warning.

IRC servers blocking Tor
========================

Some IRC servers block connections from Tor because
Tor is sometimes used to send spam.

- [OFTC and Tor](https://www.oftc.net/Tor/)
- [List of IRC/chat networks that block or support Tor](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/BlockingIrc)

Adding support for another protocol
===================================

For security reasons, it is only possible to use IRC and XMPP with
<span class="application">Pidgin</span> in Tails. Here are the
prerequisites to enable another protocol that is supported by <span
class="application">Pidgin</span> otherwise:

- The support in <span class="application">Pidgin</span> for this protocol has been successfully tested
  in Tails.

- Someone volunteers to maintain the corresponding support in Tails
  on the long term.

- Someone has verified that the security record of the desired plugin
  (including open bugs) is good enough.
