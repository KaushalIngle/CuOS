Connecting to a local network
=============================

You can connect to a local network using a wired, Wi-Fi, or mobile data
connection:

1. Open the system menu in the top-right corner.

   - If a wired connection is detected, Tails automatically connects to the network.

   - To connect to a Wi-Fi network, choose <span class="guilabel">Wi-Fi Not
     Connected</span> and then <span class="guilabel">Select Network</span>.

   <div class="bug">

   <p>If there is no option to connect to a Wi-Fi network, your Wi-Fi interface
   is not working in Tails. See our documentation on [[troubleshooting Wi-Fi
   not working|no-wifi]].</p>

   </div>

   - To connect to a mobile data network, choose
     <span class="guilabel">Mobile Broadband</span>.

   <div class="note">
   <p>It is currently impossible to connect to a network using:</p>

   <ul>
   <li>Dial-up modems.</li>
   <li>VPNs, see [[the corresponding FAQ|support/faq#vpn]].</li>
   </ul>

   </div>

1. After you connect to a local network, the *Tor Connection* assistant
   appears to help you [[connect to the Tor network|tor]].

<span class="application">[[GNOME Help|first_steps/desktop#help]]</span>
and choose <span class="guilabel">Networking, web & email</span>.

Saving your network settings
============================

To remember the password for Wi-Fi networks and custom network configurations
across different Tails sessions, turn on the [[Network
Connections|first_steps/persistence#network_connections]] feature of
the Persistent Storage.

Modifying your network settings
===============================

To modify your network settings, for example, to configure whether or not
to automatically connect to a Wi-Fi network, choose
**Applications&nbsp;▸ System Tools&nbsp;▸ Settings&nbsp;▸ Network**.
