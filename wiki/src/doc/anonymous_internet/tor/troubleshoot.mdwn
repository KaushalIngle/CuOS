[[!meta title="Troubleshooting connecting to Tor"]]

The sections below summarize the most common problems when [[connecting to Tor|tor]].

[[!toc]]

<h2 id="clock">The computer clock is set to an incorrect time zone</h2>

The clock of the computer needs to be correct to connect to Tor.

If you choose to [[hide that you are connecting to Tor|tor#hiding]], you might
have to fix the clock manually if Tails fails to connect to Tor.

Choose **Fix Clock** in the error screen of the *Tor Connection* assistant to
set the clock and time zone of your computer.

If you have problems fixing the clock, you can instead try to restart Tails and
choose to [[connect to Tor automatically|tor#automatic]]. When connecting to
Tails automatically, Tails fixes the clock automatically by connecting to the
captive portal detection service of [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) before
connecting to Tor.

<h2 id="incorrect">You did not enter the bridge correctly</h2>

Only obfs4 bridges can be used in Tails currently.

An obfs4 bridge looks like:

    obfs4 1.2.3.4:1234 B0E566C9031657EA7ED3FC9D248E8AC4F37635A4 cert=OYWq67L7MDApdJCctUAF7rX8LHvMxvIBPHOoAp0+YXzlQdsxhw6EapaMNwbbGICkpY8CPQ iat-mode=0

You need to enter the entire line, not just the IP address and port
combination.

<h2 id="broken">The bridge is no longer operational</h2>

It is possible that the bridge that you entered is no longer working.

Try entering another bridge or requesting other bridges.
