<span class="application">Onion Circuits</span> displays information about
the current Tor circuits and connections.

To open <span class="application">Onion Circuits</span>, click on the
Tor status icon in the top-right corner and choose <span class="guimenuitem">Open Onion

The circuits established by Tor are listed in the left pane. A Tor circuit is
made of three relays:

  - The first relay or *entry guard*. If you configured Tor bridges, one of your bridges is the first relay.
  - The second relay or *middle node*.
  - The exit node.

When you connect to
a destination server, for example, when visiting a website, the connection appears in the list below the circuit
it uses.

In the example above, the connection to
<span class="code">check.torproject.org</span> goes through the relays
<span class="guilabel">tor7kryptonit</span>,
<span class="guilabel">Casper03</span>, and the exit node
<span class="guilabel">blackfish</span>.

If you click on a circuit, technical details about the relays of the circuit appear in the right pane.
