"Tor provides anonymity by building circuits with three relays. So instead of "
"connecting directly to the destination server, a connection is made between "
"each relay of the circuit and this takes more time."

"Furthermore, Tor tries to build circuits with relays in different countries "
"which make connection travel more and appear slower."

"The Tor relays are run by volunteers in a decentralized way. So all relays "
"are not of the same quality. Some are big and fast, while some others are "
"smaller and slower. As a whole, the network could be faster if it had more "
"capacity. To improve the capacity of the Tor network, you can either run a "
"Tor relay yourself or [help existing relays](https://www.torservers.net/"
"partners.html)."
