[[!meta title="Exchanging bitcoins using Electrum"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

[*Electrum*](https://electrum.org/) is a [[!wikipedia Bitcoin]] client that is
particularly suited to the context of Tails because:

  - You can use your wallet from different devices and avoid
    losing bitcoins in a backup mistake or computer failure.
  - Electrum does not download the blockchain, so there is no waiting
    time when starting.
  - You can sign transactions from an offline working session for
    additional security.

To start <span class="application">Electrum</span> choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Internet</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Electrum Bitcoin Wallet</span>
</span>.

To learn how to use *Electrum*, read the
[*Electrum* documentation](https://electrum.readthedocs.io/).

For an explanation of how Bitcoin works in simple terms, read

<div class="caution">

<p>Bitcoin is <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#is-bitcoin-anonymous">not
anonymous</a>.</p>

<p>To make it harder to relate your different transactions, you should use
a different receiving address for each transaction.
<span class="application">Electrum</span> automatically generates new
addresses for you to use.</p>

</div>

<div class="tip">

<p><span class="application">Electrum</span> uses <em>mBTC</em> as the
default base unit. 1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC. To change the base unit, choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Preferences</span></span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="caution">

<p>Do not blindly trust the bitcoin balance that <span class="application">Electrum</span>
displays as <em>unconfirmed</em>. Wait for transactions to be confirmed.</p>

Recovering your wallet from its seed
====================================

Backing up your seed
--------------------

Your wallet can be recovered entirely from its <em>seed</em>: the
chain of words generated by <span class="application">Electrum</span>
when creating the wallet. But if you lose your seed, you
lose your entire wallet.

That's why we recommend you both:

- Turn on the [[Bitcoin Client|doc/first_steps/persistence#bitcoin]]
  feature of the Persistent Storage
  to store your bitcoin wallet and preferences across separate working
  sessions.

- Backup your seed outside of Tails. For example, you can write it down
  on a piece of paper and keep it with you.

Fixing a corrupted wallet
-------------------------

If <span class="application">Electrum</span> fails to start or stays
minimized, maybe your <span class="application">Electrum</span> folder
is corrupted.

To recover your wallet from its seed:

1. Make sure that <span class="application">Electrum</span> is closed.

1. Open your <span class="filename">Home</span> folder.

1. Click on the <span class="guimenu">[[!img lib/pan-down.png alt="menu toggle"
   class="symbolic" link="no"]]</span> button in the title bar and choose
   <span class="guilabel">Show Hidden Files</span>.

1. Open the <span class="filename">.electrum</span> folder.

1. Delete the <span class="filename">wallets</span> folder.

1. Start <span class="application">Electrum</span>.

1. When creating a new wallet choose <span class="guilabel">I already
   have a seed</span> and specify the seed of your wallet.
