[[!meta title="Migrating OpenPGP configuration from Enigmail in Thunderbird 78"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

Since Tails 4.13 (November 2020), *Thunderbird* 78 replaces the
*Enigmail* extension with built-in support for OpenPGP encryption.

If you used *Enigmail* before Tails 4.13, follow the instructions below to
migrate from *Enigmail* to *Thunderbird* 78. Tails does not include *Enigmail*
2.2, the last version of the extension, which automates this migration.

FAQ](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/openpgp-thunderbird-howto-and-faq).

   account.

<h2 id="master-password">Set up a Master Password</h2>

In *Thunderbird* 78, OpenPGP private keys are not protected by a passphrase.
That's why we recommend that you set up a Master Password.

With a Master Password, your private key is encrypted in your
*Thunderbird* profile and only unlocked while *Thunderbird* is running.
If your *Thunderbird* profile is stored in your Persistent Storage, then
your private key is encrypted twice: once by *Thunderbird* in your
profile and a second time by the encryption of the Persistent Storage.

1. Choose **[[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class="symbolic"
   link="no"]]&nbsp;▸ Preferences**.

1. Choose **Privacy & Security**.

1. In the **Passwords** section, select the option **Use a master
   password**.

1. In the **Change Master Password** dialog, enter your Master Password
   and click **Ok**.

<h1 id="public">Migrate the public keys of your contacts</h1>

<h2 id="export-public">Export the public keys using the <em>Password and Keys</em> utility</h2>

From the desktop:

1. Choose **Applications&nbsp;▸ Utilities&nbsp;▸ Passwords and Keys**.

1. In the left pane, choose **GnuPG keys**.

   From File.**

1. Choose the file containing the public keys that you exported from the

   If *Thunderbird* fails to import many public keys at once, split
   these public keys into several smaller files. *Thunderbird* can only import
   public key files of less than 5 MB.

<h2 id="accept-public">Mark the public keys as accepted</h2>

By default, new public keys are not marked as "*accepted*" by *Thunderbird* and
you cannot encrypt emails to "unaccepted" keys.

   link="no"]]&nbsp;▸ Tools&nbsp;▸ OpenPGP Key Manager**.
