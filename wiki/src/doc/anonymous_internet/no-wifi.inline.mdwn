If your Wi-Fi interface is not working, for example:

* There is no Wi-Fi option in the system menu:

  [[!img no-wifi/system-without-wifi.png link="no" alt=""]]

* You receive the notification **Connection failed: Activation of network
  connection failed**.

* The interface is disabled when starting Tails or when plugging in your USB
  Wi-Fi adapter:

  [[!img no-wifi/mac-spoofing-disabled.png link="no" alt="Notification about network card being disabled"]]

  In this case, you can disable MAC address anonymization to get your Wi-Fi interface
  to work in Tails. Disabling MAC address anonymization has security implications, so read
  carefully our [[documentation about MAC
  address anonymization|first_steps/welcome_screen/mac_spoofing]] before doing so.

To connect to the Internet, you can try to:

* Use an Ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi if possible. Wired interfaces work
  much more reliably than Wi-Fi in Tails.

* Share the Wi-Fi or mobile data connection of your phone using a
  USB cable. Sharing a connection this way is called *USB tethering*.

  See instructions for:

  * [iPhones or iPads](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204023)

    Only sharing mobile data works on iPhones and iPads; sharing Wi-Fi does not work.

  <div class="caution">
  <p>Tails cannot hide the information that identifies your phone on the local network.
  If you connect your phone to:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>A Wi-Fi network, then the network will know the MAC
  address of your phone. This has security implications that are discussed in
  our [[documentation on MAC address anonymization|first_steps/welcome_screen/mac_spoofing]].
  Some phones have a feature to hide the real MAC address of the phone.</p></li>
  <li><p>A mobile data network, then
  the network will be able to know the identifier of your SIM card (IMSI)
  and also the serial number of your phone (IMEI).</p></li>
  </ul>
