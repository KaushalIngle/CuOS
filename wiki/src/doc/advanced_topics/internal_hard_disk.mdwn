[[!meta title="Accessing the internal hard disk"]]

<div class="caution">

<p>Accessing internal disks of the computer has security implications:

<ul>
  <li>You can leave traces of your activities in Tails on the hard disks.</li>
  <li>If Tails is compromised, a malware could install itself on your usual operating system.</li>
  <li>If an application in Tails is compromised, it could access private data on your disks and use it to de-anonymize you.</li>
</ul>

</p>

</div>

To access internal hard disks:

1. When starting Tails, [[set up an administration password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/]].

2. Open the [[*Files* browser|doc/first_steps/desktop#files]].

3. Click on the hard disk of your choice in the left pane.

<div class="caution">

<p>If your usual operating system is in
hibernation, accessing it might corrupt your file system. Only access your disk
if your system was shut down properly.</p>

</div>

<div class="note">

<p>If you have a GNU/Linux system on your disks, you can only access
files owned by the first user (<code>uid=1000</code>) on that system.</p>

<p>In all cases, you might encounter permissions problems. To bypass
permission limitations, you can run the <span class="application">Files</span> browser
with administration rights.</p>
