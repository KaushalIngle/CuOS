"While using a computer, all the data manipulated is written temporarily in "

"After a computer is powered off, the data in RAM disappears rapidly, but it "
"can remain in RAM up to several minutes after shutdown. An attacker having "

"電腦關閉之後，RAM 之中的資料會立即消失，但也可能會在RAM "
"保留幾分鐘之久。攻擊者若能在其完全消失前接近這台電腦，或許可以從用戶使用期間來恢復一些重要的資料。"

"As far as we know, cold boot attacks are not a common procedure for data "
"recovery, but it might still be good to be prepared. If no cold boot attack "
"happens directly after shutdown, the RAM empties itself in minutes, and all "
"data disappears."
msgstr ""
"目前所知，冷開機攻擊非為資料恢復的一般程序，但最好還是預作防備。如果關機後未立即發生冷開機攻擊，RAM 會在幾分鐘之內清除它的記憶體，讓所有資料消失。"
