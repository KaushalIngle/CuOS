"While using a computer, all the data manipulated is written temporarily in "
"[[!wikipedia Random-access_memory desc=\"RAM\"]]: texts, saved files, but "
"also passwords and encryption keys. The more recent the activity, the more "

"After a computer is powered off, the data in RAM disappears rapidly, but it "
"can remain in RAM up to several minutes after shutdown. An attacker having "

"As far as we know, cold boot attacks are not a common procedure for data "
"recovery, but it might still be good to be prepared. If no cold boot attack "
"happens directly after shutdown, the RAM empties itself in minutes, and all "
"data disappears."
