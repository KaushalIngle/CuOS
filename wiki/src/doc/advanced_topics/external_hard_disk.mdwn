[[!meta title="Starting Tails from an external hard disk"]]

When starting Tails from an external hard disk or
[[problematic USB stick|support/known_issues#problematic-usb-sticks]],
Tails might return the following error message:

    Unable to find a medium containing a live file system

In such cases, choose the **External Hard Disk** entry if it appears in
the Boot Loader.

If the **External Hard Disk** entry does not appear in the Boot Loader,
then remove the <span class="code">live-media=removable</span>
boot option. To do so, see our instructions on [[modifying the boot options using
the Boot Loader|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]].

<div class="caution">

<p>Choosing the <b>External Hard Disk</b> entry in the Boot Loader or removing
the <span class="code">live-media=removable</span> boot
option might be dangerous. If an adversary had access to the computer
and installed a malicious Tails on the internal hard disk, the computer
might start on the malicious Tails instead of on the USB stick.</p>
