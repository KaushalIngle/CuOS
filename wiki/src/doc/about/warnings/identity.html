<h2 id="metadata">Clean metadata from files before sharing them</h2>

<p>Many files contain hidden data, or metadata:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>JPEG and other image files often contain information about
where a picture was taken and which camera was used.</p></li>

<li><p>Office documents often contain information
about their author, and the date and time the document was
created.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>To help you clean metadata, Tails includes
[[<i>mat2</i>|doc/sensitive_documents/metadata]], a tool to remove metadata
in a wide range of file formats.</p>

<div class="attack">

<p>Metadata has been used in the past to locate people
from pictures they took. For an example, see
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/12/04/166487197/betrayed-by-metadata-john-mcafee-admits-hes-really-in-guatemala">NPR:
Betrayed by metadata, John McAfee admits he's really in
Guatemala</a>.</p>

<h2 id="contextual">Use Tails sessions for only one purpose at a time</h2>

<p>If you use Tails sessions for more than one purpose at a time,
an adversary could link your different
activities together.</p>

<p>For example, if you log into different accounts on the same website in a
single Tails session, the website could determine that the accounts
are used by the same person. This is because websites can tell when
2 accounts are using the same Tor circuit.</p>

<p>To prevent an adversary from linking your
activities together while using Tails, restart Tails between
different activities. For example, restart Tails between checking
your work email and your whistleblowing email.</p>

<div class="attack">

<p>We are not aware of any such attacks to deanonymize people online who
used Tails for different purposes at a time.</p>

</div>

<p>If you worry that the files in your Persistent
Storage could be used to link your activities together,
consider using a different Tails USB stick for each activity.
For example, use one Tails USB stick for your activism work and another one
for your journalism work.</p>
