<h2 id="tor">What is the relationship between Tor and Tails?</h2>

See our explanation about [[why does Tails use Tor|doc/anonymous_internet/tor/why#relationship]].

<h2 id="debian">Why is Tails based on Debian and not on another distribution?</h2>

We are deeply rooted and involved in Debian. The friendships, relationships, and
technical expertise we have in Debian have many benefits for Tails, and we are
not ready to build the same relationship with Ubuntu, OpenBSD, or any other
distribution. See our statement about our
[[contribute/relationship_with_upstream]] for details.

See also the article [Why there are so many Debian
derivatives](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2011/09/why_there_are_so_many_debian_derivatives/)
by Stefano Zacchiroli.

<h2 id="ubuntu">Why isn't Tails based on Ubuntu?</h2>

First, see the answer to the [[previous question|faq#debian]].

0. The rapid development cycle of Ubuntu would be too fast for Tails.
0. Ubuntu adds features in ways that we find dangerous for privacy. For example
   Ubuntu One
   ([partly discontinued](http://blog.canonical.com/2014/04/02/shutting-down-ubuntu-one-file-services/))
   and the [Amazon ads and data leaks](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/privacy-ubuntu-1210-amazon-ads-and-data-leaks).
0. Ubuntu is led by a company that takes most of the important decisions and has
   the power to make them happen.
0. We usually ship kernels and video drivers from [Debian
   backports](http://backports.debian.org/). The result
   is comparable to Ubuntu in terms of support for recent hardware.
0. We think that the general quality of the maintenance work being done on
   packages matters from a security perspective. Debian maintainers generally are
   experts in the fields their packages deal with; while it is generally not
   the case outside of the limited number of packages Ubuntu officially supports.
0. We are actively working on improving
   [[AppArmor support|contribute/design/application_isolation]] in Tails; a security
   framework that is already used in a few Ubuntu applications.
0. We are also working on adding compiler hardening options to more Debian
   packages included in Tails; another security feature that Ubuntu already
   provides.

<h2 id="gnome">Why does Tails ship the GNOME Desktop?</h2>

We had users ask for LXDE, XFCE, MATE, KDE, and so on, but we are not going to
change desktop. According to us, the main drawback of GNOME is that it
requires quite a lot of resources to work properly, but it has many advantages.
The GNOME Desktop is:

  - Well integrated, especially for new Linux users.
  - Very well translated and documented.
  - Doing relatively good regarding accessibility features.
  - Actively developed.
  - Well maintained in [[Debian|faq#debian]], where it is the default
    desktop environment.

We invested quite some time in acquiring GNOME
knowledge, and switching our desktop environment would require going through that
process again.

We are not proposing several desktop environments to choose from because
we want to [[limit the amount of software included in Tails|faq#new-software]].

<h1 id="hardware">Hardware compatibility</h1>

See also:

- [[System requirements|doc/about/requirements]]
- [[Known issues|support/known_issues]]

<h2 id="32-bit">Does Tails work on 32-bit computers?</h2>

No. Tails stopped working on 32-bit computer in [[Tails
3.0|news/Tails_3.0_will_require_a_64-bit_processor]] (June 2017). Software
built for 64-bit processors can benefit from several improvements that make it
harder for attackers to exploit security vulnerabilities.

Before Tails 3.0, we estimated that [[only 4% of our
users|news/Tails_3.0_will_require_a_64-bit_processor]] still had a 32-bit
computer. We decided that the increased security for everybody else was more
important than the compatibility with 32-bit computers.

<h2 id="arm">Does Tails work on ARM architecture, Raspberry Pi, tablets, smartphones (mobile phones), or Apple M1?</h2>

For the moment, Tails is only available on the x86_64 architecture.
The Raspberry Pi, most tablets, and most smartphones (mobile phones) are based on the ARM architecture. Tails does
not work on the ARM architecture so far.

For this reason, Tails does not work on Mac models that use the Apple M1 chip.

Look for a tablet with an AMD or Intel processor. Try to verify its
compatibility with Debian beforehand, for example make sure that the Wi-Fi
interface is supported.

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<h2 id="dedicated-stick">Do I need a USB stick dedicated to Tails?</h2>

Yes. Tails requires a USB stick dedicated to only running Tails.

If it were possible to use the same USB stick with another
operating system, for example to store files to use on Windows, a virus in the
other operating system could corrupt your Tails.

That's why your Tails USB stick is not recognized in Windows and
why we discourage installing other live operating systems on the same USB stick.

To store files in your Tails USB stick, use the encrypted [[Persistent
Storage|doc/first_steps/persistence]]. To exchange files between Tails and
another operating system, use a separate USB stick.

<h2 id="permanent-install">Can I install Tails permanently onto my hard disk?</h2>

This is not possible using the recommended installation methods. Tails is
designed to be a live system running from a removable media: USB stick or DVD.

This is a conscious decision as this mode of operation is better for what we
want to provide to Tails users: amnesia, the fact that Tails leaves no traces on
the computer after a session is closed.

<h2 id="unetbootin">Can I install Tails with UNetbootin, YUMI, Rufus or my other favorite tool?</h2>

No. Those installation methods are unsupported. They might not work at
all, or worse: they might seem to work, but produce a USB stick
that does *not* behave like Tails should. Follow the
[[download and installation documentation|install]] instead.

<h2 id="upgrade">Should I update Tails using <span class="code">apt upgrade</span> or <span class="application">Synaptic</span>?</h2>

No. Tails provides upgrades every six weeks, that are thoroughly tested
to make sure that no security feature or configuration gets broken.
If you upgrade the system yourself using `apt` or <span class="application">Synaptic</span>,
you might break things. Upgrading when you get a notification from
<span class="application">[[Tails Upgrader|doc/upgrade]]</span> is enough.

<h2 id="preinstalled">Can I buy a preinstalled Tails USB stick or DVD?</h2>

No, we don't sell preinstalled Tails devices.

Selling preinstalled devices would in fact be a pretty bad idea:

* If burned on a DVD, then this DVD would be outdated on the next
  release. This means after 6 weeks at most.
* If installed onto a USB stick, then it would be impossible to verify
  that the Tails on the USB stick is genuine. Trusting that a Tails USB stick
  is genuine should be based either on cryptographic verification or
  on personal trust (if you know someone you trust who can clone a Tails USB stick for you). But
  once Tails is installed on a USB stick it is not possible to use our
  cryptographic verification techniques anymore. Being able to trust
  your Tails USB stick is something that we really care about.

<h1 id="browser">Web browser</h1>

<h2 id="javascript">Why is JavaScript enabled by default in <span class="application">Tor Browser</span>?</h2>

Many websites today require JavaScript to work correctly. As a consequence
JavaScript is enabled by default in Tails to avoid confusing many users. But
*Tor Browser* takes care of [[blocking dangerous JavaScript
functionalities|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#javascript]].

Tor Browser also includes a [[security level|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_browser#security-level]] and the [[NoScript|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_browser#noscript]]
extension to optionally disable more JavaScript. This might improve
security in some cases. However, if you disable JavaScript, then the
[[fingerprint|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#fingerprint]] of your *Tor Browser*
differs from most users. This reduces your anonymity.

We think that having JavaScript enabled by default is the best possible
compromise between usability and security in this case.

<div class="note">

<p>We have plans to allow storing the security level in the Persistent Storage. ([[!tails_ticket 9700]])</p>

</div>

<h2 id="add-ons">Can I install other add-ons in <span class="application">Tor Browser</span>?</h2>

Installing add-ons in <span class="application">Tor Browser</span> might break the security built in Tails.

Add-ons can do many things within the browser, and even if all the networking goes
through Tor, some add-ons might interact badly with the rest of the
configuration or leak private information.

1. They can track and reveal information about your browsing behaviour, browsing
history, or system information, either on purpose or by mistake.

2. They can have bugs and security vulnerabilities that can be remotely exploited by an
attacker.

3. They can have bugs breaking the security offered by other add-ons
and break your anonymity.

4. They can break your anonymity by making your browsing behaviour
distinguishable amongst other Tails users.

Unless proven otherwise, no add-on, apart from the ones already
included in Tails, have been seriously audited and should be
considered safe to use in this context.

<div class="next">
  <ul>

</div>

<!--
XXX: Push that information to the browser documentation?
XXX: Check https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#recommendedextensions

<h2 id="update-add-ons">Should I manually update add-ons included in <span class="application">Tor Browser</span>?</h2>

No. Tails provides upgrades every six weeks, that are thoroughly tested
to make sure that no security feature or configuration gets broken.
Updating add-ons in <span class="application">Tor Browser</span> might
break the security built in Tails.

<h2 id="anonymity-test">How to analyse the results of online anonymity tests?</h2>

Fingerprinting websites, such as <https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/>,
try to retrieve as much information as possible from
your browser to see if it can be used to identify you.

As explained in our documentation about
[[the fingerprint of *Tor Browser* in Tails|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#fingerprint]], Tails provides anonymity by
making it difficult to distinguish a particular user amongst all the users of
<span class="application">Tor Browser</span> (either in Tails or on other operating systems).

So, the information retrieved by such fingerprinting websites is not harmful for
anonymity in itself, as long as it is the same for all users of <span class="application">Tor Browser</span>.

For example, the user-agent string of <span class="application">Tor Browser</span> includes
<em>Windows NT</em> but this value preserves your anonymity even if
you run Windows NT. On the other hand, changing this value makes you distinguishable from
other users of <span class="application">Tor Browser</span> and, as a
consequence, weakens your anonymity.

Furthermore, we verify the result of those websites before each release, see our
[[test suite|contribute/release_process/test]].

<h2 id="java">Is Java installed in the <span class="application">Tor Browser</span>?</h2>

Tails does not include a Java plugin in its browser because it could break your anonymity.

<h1 id="persistent-storage">Persistent Storage</h1>

<h2 id="custom-settings">Can I save my custom settings?</h2>

<em>&hellip; like Tor Browser preferences, Tor configuration, desktop
background, mouse and touchpad settings, etc.</em>

By default Tails does not save anything from one session to another.
Only the Persistent Storage allows you to reuse data across different Tails
sessions. See the [[list of features of the Persistent Storage|doc/first_steps/persistence#configure]].

We are frequently requested to add new features to the Persistent Storage but we are usually
busy working on other priorities. See the
[[!tails_gitlab
groups/tails/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=✓&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=C%3APersistence
desc="list of issues about the Persistent Storage"]].

<h2 id="luks">How strong is the encryption of the Persistent Storage and LUKS?</h2>

Tails uses LUKS to encrypt the Persistent Storage. This is the same technique as
the one we recommend for [[creating and using encrypted
volumes|doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes]] in general.

LUKS is a very popular standard for disk encryption in Linux. LUKS is the
default technique for full-disk encryption proposed by many distributions,
including Debian and Ubuntu, when installing a regular system.

The Persistent Storage is created with the default LUKS parameters used
by `udisks` and `cryptsetup`.

To understand better how the Persistent Storage works, see our [[design
document|contribute/design/persistence]].

<h2 id="recover-passphrase">Is it possible to recover the passphrase of the Persistent Storage?</h2>

No. The encryption of the Persistent Storage is very strong and it is
impossible to recover the passphrase of the Persistent Storage. If the passphrase
is weak enough, an attacker can try many
possible passphrases and end up guessing your passphrase.
Such an attack is called [[!wikipedia Brute_force_attack desc="*brute-force attack*"]].

<h1 id="networking">Networking</h1>

<h2 id="vpn">Can I use Tails with a VPN?</h2>

Tails does not work with VPNs.

There are three scenarios where a VPN would be involved in Tails:

  - Using a VPN instead of Tor.
  - Using a VPN to connect to Tor (VPN before Tor).
  - Connecting to a VPN using Tor (VPN after Tor).

For more information, see our [[!tails_blueprint desc="blueprint on VPN support" vpn_support]].

### Using a VPN instead of Tor

Unlike Tor, using a VPN does not provide anonymity.

Tor provides anonymity by making it impossible for a single point in the
network to know both the origin and destination of a connection.

With VPNs, the administrators of the VPN can know both where you are
connecting from and where you are connecting to.

It is [[fundamental to Tails|doc/anonymous_internet/tor/why]] that all outgoing traffic be
forced through Tor. We have no plans to make it possible to use a VPN
*instead* of Tor in the future.

### Using a VPN to connect to Tor (VPN before Tor)

In some situations, you might need to use a VPN to connect to Tor.
For example, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) might restrict connections to Tor relays.

In these situations, try using
[[Tor bridges|doc/anonymous_internet/tor]] to
bypass the restrictions imposed by your ISP or local network.

It is currently impossible to use a VPN in Tails to connect to Tor.
We might make this possible in the future. ([[!tails_ticket 17843]])

### Connecting to a VPN using Tor (VPN after Tor)

In some situations, it can be useful to connect to a VPN through Tor:

  - To access services that block connections coming from Tor.
  - To access resources only available inside a VPN, for example, a server at
    your company or university.

It is currently impossible to connect to a VPN in Tails using Tor.
We might make this possible in the future. ([[!tails_ticket 5858]])

<h2 id="torrc">Can I choose the country of my exit nodes or further edit the <span class="code">torrc</span>?</h2>

Editing the Tor configuration file, also called `torrc`, to modify how Tor
creates circuits can weaken your anonymity in ways that are hard to understand
and explain. That is why we don't explain how to modify the Tor configuration
file in Tails, for example, to choose the country of your exit nodes or exclude
some entry guards.

<h2 id="dns">How does the DNS resolution work in Tails?</h2>

See our [[design document|contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/DNS]] on this topic.

<h2 id="htp">Why does Tails automatically connect to several websites when starting?</h2>

The clock of the computer needs to be set at the correct time to both:

1. Be able to connect to the Tor network in the first place

   The computer clock is fixed a first time, approximately, before connecting
   to Tor, either [[automatically|doc/anonymous_internet/tor#automatic]] or
   [[manually|doc/anonymous_internet/tor/troubleshoot#clock]].

2. Protect your anonymity while using Tor

   The computer clock is fixed a second time, precisely, to prevent a website
   from identifying you by analyzing minor differences of your computer clock
   with the correct time.

   This second synchronization is made by sending HTTPS queries through Tor to several
   websites and deducing a correct time from their answers. You can see the
   list of websites that Tails can connect to in *[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/default/htpdate.pools desc="/etc/default/htpdate.pools"]]*.

See also our [[design document on time synchronization|contribute/design/Time_syncing]].

<h2 id="relay">Can I help the Tor network by running a relay or a bridge in Tails?</h2>

It is currently impossible to run a Tor relay or bridge in Tails.

<h2 id="onion-service">Can I run a Tor onion service on Tails?</h2>

It is technically possible to use Tails to provide an onion service
but it is complicated and not documented yet.

<h2 id="ping">Can I use <span class="command">ping</span> in Tails?</h2>

It is impossible to use <span class="command">ping</span> in Tails,
because <span class="command">ping</span> uses the ICMP protocol while Tor
can only transport TCP connections.

<h1 id="software">Software not included in Tails</h1>

<h2 id="new-software">Can my favorite software be included in Tails?</h2>

First of all, make sure that this software is already available in Debian, as
this is a requirement to be included in Tails. Adding to Tails software which is
not in Debian imply an additional workload that could compromise the
sustainability of the project. On top of that, being in Debian brings many
advantages:

  - It is included in the Debian process for security updates and new versions.
  - It is authenticated using OpenPGP signatures.
  - It is under the scrutiny of the Debian community and its many users and
    derivatives, including Ubuntu.

To check whether a software is in Debian, search for it on
<https://packages.debian.org/>. If it is not yet available in Debian, you should
ask its developers why it is not the case yet.

Second, this software might not be useful to accomplish our design goals. Refer
to our [[design documents|contribute/design]] to understand which are
the intended use cases, and the assumptions on which Tails is based.

We also try to limit the amount of software included in Tails, and we only add
new software with a very good reason to do so:

  - We try to limit the growth of the images and automatic upgrades.
  - More software implies more security issues.
  - We avoid proposing several options to accomplish the same task.
  - If a package needs to be removed after its inclusion, for example because of
    security problems, then this might be problematic as users might rely on it.

After considering all this, if you still think that this software is a good
candidate to be included in Tails, please explain us your
proposal on [[tails-dev@boum.org|about/contact#tails-dev]].

<div class="tip">

<p>If a software is not included in Tails, but is included in Debian, you can use
the [[Additional
Software|doc/first_steps/persistence#additional_software]] feature of
the Persistent Storage to install it automatically every time you start Tails.</p>

</div>

Here is some of the software we are often asked to include in Tails:

  - **monero**: not in Debian, but see [[!tails_ticket 17823]]
  - **bitmessage**: not in Debian
  - **retroshare**: not in Debian
  - **rar/unrar**: is not [[free software|doc/about/license]], but you can use the
	[[additional software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]] feature to install it

<h2 id="bittorrent">Can I download using BitTorrent with Tails?</h2>

Tails does not ship any BitTorrent software and is unlikely to do so in the
future.

The problem with using BitTorrent over Tor is double:

  - It is technically hard to do it properly, see:
    <https://blog.torproject.org/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea>.
  - It harms the network, see:
    <https://blog.torproject.org/why-tor-slow-and-what-were-going-do-about-it>.

<h2 id="youtube">Can I download videos from websites?</h2>

You can install <span class="code">youtube-dl</span> as an [[additional
package|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]. <span class="application">youtube-dl</span>
allows downloading videos from more than
[700 websites](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.md).

For example, to download a YouTube video, execute the following command
in a terminal:

    torsocks youtube-dl "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWII85UlzKw"

For more information, refer to the official
[<span class="application">youtube-dl</span> website](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html).

<h2 id="monero">How can I use Monero in Tails?</h2>

You can install the [[*Feather*|doc/advanced_topics/feather]] Monero wallet as
an AppImage.

Tails currently does not include a Monero wallet. However, we are interested
in making it easier to use Monero in Tails in the future. See [[!tails_ticket
17823]] for a list of unofficial guides on how to use Monero in Tails.

<h2 id="voip">Can I do voice or video calls from Tails?</h2>

Not yet.

- Videoconferencing tools that work in web browsers, like *Jitsi*, *Google
  Meet*, and *BigBlueButton*, don't work in *Tor Browser* yet.

  They rely on the [[!wikipedia WebRTC]] technology, which uses
  [[!wikipedia User_Datagram_Protocol desc="UDP"]] connections. But, the Tor network only
  supports TCP connections, like the ones used for HTTP and email.

  The Tor Project is working on [supporting UDP traffic over
  Tor](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/torspec/-/issues/73), which
  should remove this limitation.

- Proprietary applications like *Skype* or *Zoom* will never be available in
  Tails because they are not Free Software.

- [*Mumble*](https://www.mumble.com/) is the only voice chat application that
  we know works from Tails. You can use the [[Additional
  Software|doc/first_steps/persistence#additional_software]] feature to add
  *Mumble* to your Tails.

  [*Wahay*](https://wahay.org/) is a decentralized voice chat application based
  on *Mumble*. If you are a Debian developer, please help us
  [[!tails_ticket 17617 desc="get *Wahay* in Debian"]].

<h1 id="misc">Other security issues</h1>

<h2 id="older-version">Is it safe to use an older version of Tails?</h2>

It is not safe to use an older version of Tails. Only the latest version of
Tails should be used.

Because it is not safe to use an older version of Tails, we distribute only
the latest version of Tails.

Older versions of Tails have security vulnerabilities and other issues that
are fixed in the latest version of Tails.

We understand why you might want to use an older version of Tails. For
example, the latest version of Tails might not be compatible with your
hardware.

If you are experiencing an issue with the latest version of Tails, you can
check our [[list of known issues|support/known_issues]] to find out if there
is a workaround for the issue you are experiencing.

If there is no known workaround for the issue you are experiencing, you might
want to [[make a bug report|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]] to let us know
about the issue.

<h2 id="old-software">Why does Tails include old versions of software?</h2>

Tails includes the software versions that are found in
[Debian stable](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable). Even though the
software versions might be old, they receive security fixes through the
[Debian security team](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Security).

<h2 id="integrity">Can I verify the integrity of a Tails USB stick or DVD?</h2>

It is impossible to verify the integrity of a Tails USB stick or DVD while running Tails
from it. It would be like asking to someone whether they are
lying: a true liar would always pretend to tell the truth.

If you worry that your Tails might be corrupted, do a [[manual
upgrade|upgrade]] from a trusted operating system to
upgrade it to a trusted version of Tails.

<h2 id="reuse-memory-wipe">Can I use the memory wipe feature of Tails on another operating system?</h2>

The memory wipe mechanism that Tails uses on shutdown to [[protect against cold
boot attacks|doc/advanced_topics/cold_boot_attacks]] should be reusable in
other Linux distributions.

If you want to implement this feature outside of Tails, have a look at the
corresponding [[design documentation|contribute/design/memory_erasure]].

<h2 id="new-identity">Where is the <span class="guilabel">New Identity</span> button?</h2>

There is no <span class="guilabel">New Identity</span> button for Tails as a
whole.

The [[<span class="guilabel">New Identity</span> feature of
<span class="application">Tor Browser</span>|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#new-identity]]
is limited to the browser.

In the same way as the <span class="guilabel">New Identity</span> button of
<span class="application">Tor Browser</span> restarts the browser, you have to
restart Tails before using a different identity.

See also our warning about [[using Tails sessions for only one purpose at a time|doc/about/warnings/identity#contextual]].

<h2 id="antivirus">Does Tails need an antivirus?</h2>

No, as other Linux systems, Tails doesn't require an antivirus to protect itself
from most malwares, such as viruses, trojans, and worms. There are various reasons
why Linux operating systems generally don't need antivirus softwares, including
the permission design of Linux systems.

See the [[!wikipedia Linux_malware desc="Wikipedia page on Linux malware"]]
for further details.
