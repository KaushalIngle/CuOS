Tails does not start at all on Mac models that use the Apple M1 chip and on
many other Mac models.

Apple does not prioritize collaborating with Free Software projects. Their
newest hardware is usually very hard for Free Software developers to get
working with Linux, and thus Tails. PC hardware tends to be more open and work
better with Linux.

On some computers with a Marvell Avastar 88W8897 Wi-Fi adapter, such
as some Microsoft Surface Pro models, Tails fails to connect to
Wi-Fi networks.

If you experience this problem, you can try to [[disable MAC address
anonymization|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/mac_spoofing]] that sometimes
fixes it.

On some computers with a RTL8723be Wi-Fi adapter, Tails might fail to discover
Wi-Fi networks, provide unreliable Wi-Fi connections, or have poor Wi-Fi
performance.

You can try to [[add the following boot options when starting
Tails|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]] until you find a
combination that works for you. The exact combination of options that works
depends on the computer:

- <span class="command">rtl8723be.fwlps=0 rtl8723be.ips=0</span>

- <span class="command">rtl8723be.ant_sel=1</span>

<h3 id="broadcom-sta-dkms">Broadcom Wi-Fi network interface needing <code>broadcom-sta-dkms</code></h3>

<!--
Last updated: 2019-01-29
-->

Some Broadcom Wi-Fi interfaces require the
[`wl`](https://wiki.debian.org/wl) driver, provided by the
`broadcom-sta-dkms` Debian package, to work in Tails.

The `wl` driver is not included in Tails because it is proprietary.

Your device requires the `wl` driver if it is in the list of devices
supported by the `broadcom-sta-dkms` package on the corresponding
[Debian wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/wl). If you find your device
in the list of supported devices, then it is impossible to use your
Wi-Fi card in Tails.

To workaround this issue, you can try to:

- Use other USB ports. For example, use USB 2 ports instead of USB 3
  ports and vice versa.

- Enable these 3 options in the BIOS

  - xHCI handoff
  - EHCI handoff
  - IOMMU controller

- [[Add the following boot option when
  starting Tails|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]:

      amd_iommu=on iommu=pt

- Disable IOMMU in the BIOS then enable it again.

Some of these workarounds might disable some of the USB ports.

On some computers, _Tor Browser_ and _Thunderbird_ are displayed incorrectly:

 - The application window is initially empty and white.
 - The icons and menus only appear when hovered by the mouse.
 - The contents of the window is only displayed in stripes when scrolling.

To workaround this issue, [[add the following boot option when
starting Tails|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]]:

    intel_iommu=off

This problem affects at least the following computers:

 - MacBookPro11,5
 - other MacBooks with a Radeon R9 graphics adapter

<h2 id="automatic-upgrade-fails">Tails fails to start or behaves weirdly after an automatic upgrade</h2>

<!--
Last updated: 2019-07-31

Sometimes, after an automatic upgrade, your Tails might either:

- Fail to start. Often after the message:

  <pre>Loading, please wait...</pre>

- Behave weirdly. For example, your keyboard does not work or you cannot
  connect to a network.

To fix this problem, you can [[update your Tails
manually|doc/upgrade/#manual]].

<h2 id="persistence-disappears"><em>Persistent</em> folder disappears and data of the Persistent Storage is unavailable</h2>

<!--
Last updated: 2019-07-31

We should remove this section after the new Persistent Storage is
released unless this issue is still reported to help desk in #17116.
-->

Sometimes, the *Persistent* folder is missing and
all the data of the Persistent Storage is unavailable.

Most likely this means that the *persistence.conf*
file has disappeared. However, the files in the
*Persistent* folder and all the other data in the Persistent Storage
should still exist.

If you encounter this problem, you can either:

- Turn on again the feature of the Persistent Storage that you need:

  1. Unlock the Persistent Storage in
     the Welcome Screen when starting Tails.

  1. Choose
     <span class="menuchoice">
       <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guimenuitem">Configure persistent volume</span></span>.

  1. If you are asked to enter a passphrase, enter the same passphrase that you
     use to unlock your Persistent Storage.

  1. Turn on the features of the Persistent Storage that you had turned on previously.

  1. Click <span class="bold">Save</span>, then restart Tails.

  Your *Persistent* folder and all the data of the Persistent Storage
  should be restored.

- Restore the *persistence.conf* file from its backup:

  1. Unlock the Persistent Storage and [[set up an administration password
     |doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]] when
     starting Tails.

  1. Execute the following command in a *Terminal*:

         sudo cp -a /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/persistence.conf{.bak,}

If neither of the above instructions fixes the problem, you might need to fix the
ownership of `TailsData_unlocked`.

To fix the ownership of TailsData_unlocked, set an administration password and
execute the following command in a terminal:

    sudo chown root:root /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked

<h2 id="video-memory">Tails does not erase video memory</h2>

Tails doesn't erase the [[!wikipedia Video_RAM_(dual-ported_DRAM) desc="video memory"]].

When you restart your computer after using Tails, it might briefly display the
last screen that was displayed in Tails.

If you shut down your computer instead of restarting it, the video memory will
erase itself automatically after some time.

See [[!tails_ticket 5356 desc="Erase video memory on shutdown"]].
