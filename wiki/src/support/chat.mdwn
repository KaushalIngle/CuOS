[[!meta title="Chat"]]

Join our XMPP chat room to ask questions about Tails.

To do so, you need an XMPP account. You can sign up for an
XMPP account at [Disroot](https://disroot.org/services/xmpp)
or any other XMPP account provider.

Then configure your preferred instant messaging client, for example
[[Pidgin|http://www.pidgin.im/]], which runs on Windows, GNU/Linux, and
macOS, to connect to:

* server: `chat.disroot.org`
* room: `tails`
* Use TLS/SSL to connect!
