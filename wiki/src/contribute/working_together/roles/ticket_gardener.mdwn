[[!meta title="Ticket gardener"]]
[[!meta robots="noindex"]]

The aim of ticket gardening is to ensure that items tracked on GitLab stay
relevant and contain helpful information for bringing a task to completion.  To
achieve this goal contributors and teams need to be made aware of the existence
of issues that need their input so they can self-organize and prioritize their
work. Issues that are not relevant anymore should be closed.

This work should be done every quarter.

## Manual tasks

### Go through relevant GitLab views

* [[!tails_gitlab
  groups/tails/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=T%3AWait
  desc="`T:Wait` label"]]:
  check if what was blocking was eventually resolved outside of Tails.
  Issues should either have an assignee, their `T:` label
  requalified, be rejected, or stay in this state.

* [[!tails_gitlab
  groups/tails/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=✓&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Doing&assignee_id=None
  desc="WIP without assignee"]]:
  identify issues that have a majority of work completed and could
  somewhat easily be finished. Create a list of those issues and send
  them to the responsible team; if that team cannot handle these issues,
  set the status label to something other than *Doing*.

### Identify and fix inadequate milestone

Some issues are missed by our automated
setup. These issues are those whose milestone has been
postponed after the N last releases by the Release Manager: every such
milestone bump counts as an update so there's no chance the issue will
ever be identified as stalled. Hence we need to manually
identify these issues and remove their milestone.

To select the corresponding issues:

1. List [[!tails_gitlab groups/tails/-/issues desc="issues in the `tails` group"]]
2. Filter the list to only include issues whose milestone is set to the next
   Tails release.
3. Filter the list to only include issues that were postponed at least twice
   in a row by the RM: they have `missed:$version` labels.

#### Criteria

Situations when dropping the milestone would be inadequate:

* If the issue was (re)assigned to the assignee recently.
* If there's been progress but it's not documented on the issue.
* If it's part of a sponsor deliverable.
  - If the official deadline is in the future, most of the time we don't want
    to touch the milestone.

Whether it's appropriate to drop the milestone depends on:

* When the last action on the issue by the assignee was performed. For
  example, if they did not update the issue since 3 months or more.
* If the issue was recently postponed be the RM and not by the assignee
  themselves — the latter would suggest they have it in mind and are updating
  their plans.
* Whether there's an assignee. If there's none but the issue was postponed a few times, then:
  - Either it's important and it should be put on the plate of a core team.
  - Or it's unimportant and the milestone should be dropped: keeping it
    has little value. If someone wants to track
    those issues, there surely are better ways.
* Whether the issue is blocked by anything (other issues or what not) that's
  out of the hands of the assignee.
* How safe/privileged is the assignee's position in Tails. For contributors
  that hold more power than average we can assume they know how to revert our
  changes.

#### Template comment

We have a [[template message|ticket_gardener/inadequate_milestone]]
that we can use as a basis to explain why we're removing the milestone.

## Automated tasks

Make sure dependencies are installed:

    sudo apt install -y python3-django python3-gitlab podman

To avoid unneeded overhead in the next step, it can be good to first run a
cleanup of GitLab users (see [[!tails_gitlab tails/sysadmin/-/issues/17823]]
for latest sane parameters):

    GITLAB_NAME=TailsRoot ./bin/gitlab-users-cleanup \
        --min-creation-age='29 days' \
        --min-inactivity='28 days' \
        --active \
        --max-post-sign-up-activity='120 days' \
        --max-contribution-events=0 \
        --action=deactivate-or-block

To run the automated triaging processes described below, execute
the following commands:

    ./config/gitlab-triage/bin/ensure-up-to-date-container-image && \
    ./bin/gitlab-triage-gardener \
        --host-url "$(bin/gitlab-url TailsGardener)" \
        --token "$(bin/gitlab-api-token TailsGardener)"

This can take a few dozens of minutes to complete.
You can pass any extra `gitlab-triage` option, such as `--dry-run`.

Implementation:

 - uses [GitLab Triage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-triage)
 - [[!tails_gitweb bin/gitlab-triage-gardener]]
 - [[!tails_gitweb_dir config/gitlab-triage]]

### Stalled WIP

* Scope = issues assigned to somebody, labeled *Doing*,
  and not updated for a while

* Output = a summary issue, which:
   - mentions each GitLab user who has such issues assigned to them;
     this adds an item to the To-Do list of these users
   - lists these issues, grouped by assignee

### Stalled validation

* Scope = issues assigned to somebody, labeled *Needs Validation*,
  and not updated for a while

* Output = a summary issue, which:
   - mentions each GitLab user who has such issues assigned to them;
     this adds an item to the To-Do list of these users
   - lists these issues, grouped by assignee

### Stalled merge requests

* Scope = merge requests assigned to somebody not updated for a while

* Output = a summary issue, which:
   - mentions each GitLab user who has such MRs assigned to them;
     this adds an item to the To-Do list of these users
   - lists these MRs, grouped by assignee
