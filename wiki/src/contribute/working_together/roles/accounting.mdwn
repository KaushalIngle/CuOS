The Accounting Team is responsible for:

- Accounting:
  - Keeping an accounting of the money held by our fiscal sponsors.
  - Tell workers when they can get paid for their work.
  - Process reimbursements of contributors' expenses.
  - Interface with our fiscal sponsors.

- Budgeting:
  - Build financial reports for both internal and public use.
  - Propose a budget each year to plan our expenses. This
    process also helps review the work of the different teams,
    adjust their mission, check the availability, needs, and desires of
    workers, etc.
  - Help the Board take decisions on how to spend our money. The
    Accounting Team is *not* the entity that decides how our money is
    spent and this is the responsability of a larger set of
    contributors, usually the Board, sometimes
