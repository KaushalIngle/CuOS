# Goals

The Tails system administrators set up and maintain the infrastructure
that supports the development and operations of Tails. We aim at
making the life of Tails contributors easier, and to improve the quality of
the Tails releases.

# Main responsibilities

These are the main responsibilities of Tails Sysadmins:

* Deal with hardware purchase, upgrades and failures.
* Install and upgrade operating systems and [[services|contribute/working_together/roles/sysadmins/services]].
* Organize on [[shifts|contribute/working_together/roles/sysadmins/shifts]].
* Discuss, support and implement requests from teams.
* Have root access to all hosts.

# Communication within Tails

In order to maintain good communication with the rest of Tails, Sysadmins should:

* Report once a month in tails-assembly@ about activities.
* Maintain an up-to-date public [[shift calendar|https://meel.puscii.nl/home/tails-sysadmins@puscii.nl/Calendar.html]].
* Read e-mail at least twice a week.
* Triage and garden [issues in the `tails/sysadmin` GitLab project](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/sysadmin/issues).

<a id="relations"></a>

# External relations

While dealing with organizations and people who are not part of Tails, Sysadmins should:

* Serve as an interface between Tails and hosting providers.
* Relate to (server-side software) upstream according to the broader [[Tails principles|contribute/relationship_with_upstream]].
* Treat system administration like a (free) software development project. This
  is why we try to publish as much as possible of our systems configuration,
  and to manage our whole infrastructure with configuration management tools.
  That is, without needing to log into hosts:
  * We want to enable people to participate without needing an account
    on the Tails servers.
  * We want to review the changes that are applied to our systems.
  * We want to be able to easily reproduce our systems via
    automatic deployment.
  * We want to share knowledge with other people.
* Use Free Software, as defined by the [Debian Free Software
  Guidelines](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines).
  The firmware our systems might need are the only exception to
  this rule.

# Necessary and useful skills and competences

The main tools used to manage the Tails infrastructure are:

* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) GNU/Linux; in the vast majority of
  cases, we run the current stable release.
* [Puppet](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet),
  a configuration management system.
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to host and deploy configuration,
  including our [[Puppet code|contribute/git#puppet]]

Other useful skills:

* Patience and diligence.
* Ability to self-manage (by oneself and within the team), prioritize and plan.
