# Duties

The Tails Foundations Team is responsible for:

* [[Release Management|roles/release_manager]]

* maintaining the core Tails system, which includes e.g.
  - porting Tails to the new version of its upstream foundations, such
    as a new Debian, Tor or Tor Browser;
  - keeping our core code base up-to-date and maintainable, e.g.
    refactor or clean up stuff that has bit-rotted, migrate code that
    would otherwise rely on obsolete technologies;
  - maintaining the Tails ISO and USB images build system;
  - doing the _extra_ peer-review and
    [[release management|release manager]] work that corresponds to
    the above bullet points;

* welcoming and mentoring new code contributors;

* reviewing code contributions
  in a timely manner (1 week in general, up to 2 weeks if needed in exceptional
  cases). If nobody on the Foundations Team can take care of a given MR,
  it's the Foundations Team's responsibility to ask for help:
  [[!tails_gitlab groups/tails/-/merge_requests desc="Merge Requests
  (MRs)"]], and in particular [[!tails_gitlab
  groups/tails/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=✓&state=opened&assignee_id=None&wip=no
  desc="unassigned Merge Requests (MRs) that are not marked as
  drafts"]]

* triaging issues forwarded by [[Help Desk]].

  The members of the Foundations Team who share the "frontdesk" workload are
  subscribed to the mailing list that receives bug reports:
  <tails-bugs@boum.org>. In order to raise FT's attention on a specific report,
  Help Desk replies to it on that mailing list, adding a `[FT]` tag in
  the subject.

  Then, Foundations Team "frontdesk" checks how important each issue forwarded
  by Help Desk is, whether it's worth documenting it, and validates the
  workarounds. If it's worth documenting the problem and possibly the
  workarounds, either put it on our Technical Writers' plate, or draft something
  directly, or merge a draft proposed by Technical Writer apprentices;

* triaging
  [newly created issues](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/groups/tails/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&not[label_name][]=To%20Do&not[label_name][]=Doing&not[label_name][]=Needs%20Validation&not[label_name][]=Rejected&assignee_id=None&sort=created_date)
  when they are more technical than feature
  request (those are handled by the UX designers) or about bugs;
  reassigning to whoever is on Help Desk duty any new issue that's
  really a support request;

* ensuring that development discussions started on
  <tails-dev@boum.org> are followed-up;

* proposing a release schedule for next year once Mozilla's own
  schedule is available (generally during Q3), ensuring everyone
  affected is aware of it and OK with it (e.g. team managers for
  sponsor deliverables), leading this discussion to a conclusion,
  updating the [[contribute/calendar]] accordingly, and asking
  <tails-rm@boum.org> to decide between themselves how they will share
  the [[roles/release_manager]] shifts; things to keep in mind:

  - An emergency release is often needed shortly after [[!wikipedia Pwn2Own]].

* deal with last minute emergency fixes needed during release process,
  e.g. [[!tails_ticket 14962]];

* if time allows, do whatever code task the project sees as
  top-priority, such as fixing Holes in the Roof, important bugs, or
  implementing a feature that is needed to keep Tails relevant.

* Maintain Tails relevant Debian packages in Debian
  - Role: being the fallback, on behalf of Tails, to ensure these packages are
    well maintained in Debian (it's OK, and even great, if other pkg-privacy
    members do part of the work).
  - Tasks:
     - [Maintain a bunch of packages](https://udd.debian.org/dmd/?email1=&email2=&email3=&packages=libgsecuredelete+libotr+mat+nautilus-wipe+onioncircuits+onionshare+pidgin-otr+torsocks&ignpackages=&format=html#todo).
       - `mat` will be removed from this list once the Stretch LTS lifetime is
         over (June 2022).
       - `pidgin-otr` and `libotr` will be removed from this list once we don't ship Pidgin anymore
         ([[!tails_ticket 8573]])
     - [Review and sponsor a few more packages](https://udd.debian.org/dmd/?email1=&email2=&email3=&packages=bilibop+keyringer&ignpackages=&format=html#todo).
       - `keyringer` could be removed from this list if all teams migrated to [[!debpts pass]]
     - Track Debian bugs and forward them upstream.
  - Duration:
     - as long as we ship these packages in Tails
     - until the EOL of the last Debian stable release (including
       LTS) we put it in, even if we drop the package from Tails:
       including a package in a stable Debian release implies
       a commitment to maintain it during its lifetime.
  - In order to communicate expectations to the person who wears this hat,
    Tails contributors can:
      - use the Debian BTS
      - mention `@debian-packages-maintainers` on our [[!tails_gitlab
        desc="GitLab"]]
  - Not in the scope of this work:
    * Perl libraries our custom software depends on: intrigeri does it
      as a volunteer with his Debian hat.
    * [[!debpts torbrowser-launcher]]: we only use its AppArmor
      profiles, that we could easily take from upstream if the Debian
      package was not maintained.

* Maintain AppArmor in Debian (starting on 2022-07-01)

  Scope:

   - maintenance work that is necessary to keep the status quo working
     and up-to-date wrt. packaging best practices;

   - maintainer due care, such as forwarding bug reports upstream
     (even for bugs that don't affect Tails);

   - work on specific improvements that Tails would particularly
     benefit from;

   - onboarding and mentoring new co-maintainers.

* Track bugs related to the aforementioned packages in Tails and forward them
  to Debian.

* Maintain the backend of the [[verification
  JavaScript|install/inc/js/download.js]] that is used on our download pages.
  For example, update it to new versions of the Forge library. See its
  [[release process|contribute/release_process/verification_javascript]].

# Meetings

## Attendees

These meetings are primarily meant to coordinate the work of the most active
members of the team. Other team members are welcome to join, but not
expected to.

## Daily stand-up meeting

We have a short stand-up meeting every work day at 11:00 CET/CEST.

The most active team members are expected to attend at least half of
these meetings.

## Monthly'ish meeting

At the beginning of every release cycle, we replace one daily stand-up meeting
with a 1-hour meeting focused on bigger-picture-y topics, such as:

 - coordinating work for this release cycle
 - looking further ahead: zooming out to our roadmap
 - sharing feedback

Logistics:

- **Date**: the Wednesday that immediately follows a scheduled release
- **Time**: 16:00 CET/CEST
- **Location and Agenda**: see https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/foundations/-/wikis/meetings/next

If you cannot make one of these meetings, please share with the team, before the
meeting:

 - a brief status update about life, work, and blockers;
 - information about how your plans for this release cycle.

# Tasks management

This section documents the principles and guidelines we use for tracking
[[!tails_gitlab
tails/tails/-/boards/4?&label_name%5B%5D=Core%20Work%3AFoundations%20Team
desc="our tasks"]].

This applies on top of the broader Tails project's tasks management
guidelines:

 - [[contribute/working_together/GitLab]]
 - [[How to document progress|contribute/working_together/GitLab#document-progress]]

<a id="tasks-management-pick"></a>

## How to pick your next task

<div class="note">
This is an initial draft, to be refined while learning from experience :)
</div>

Among the Foundations Team issues, in decreasing order of priority :

1. Milestone is the upcoming version, for good reasons.
2. Grant deliverable with a deadline.
3. Milestone is the version that follows the upcoming release, for good reasons.
4. Has a `$YEAR` label, which means this issue is on our roadmap.
5. [[UX debt|foundations_team#tasks-management-ux-improvements]]
6. Priority is high (`P:High` label)
7. Priority is elevated (`P:Elevated` label)

<a id="tasks-management-milestone"></a>
<a id="tasks-management-target-version"></a>

## Milestone

The Foundation Team treats the _Milestone_ field as a commitment.
Other Tails teams, contributors, and users should be able to rely on
the value of this field.

An issue
[[!tails_gitlab
tails/tails/-/boards/4?&label_name%5B%5D=Core%20Work%3AFoundations%20Team
desc="owned by the Foundations Team"]]
should have a milestone set if, and only if, at least
one of these conditions is met:

 - External constraints determine the timeline of our work.
   For example, we have to upgrade to the next Tor Browser
   major release.

 - We are _very_ confident we will complete the task in time for
   a specific release and we have a good reason to focus on it.
   For example, work in progress tasks can be good candidates,
   as opposed to starting work on a new task.

Postponing a task to the next milestone more than once is not
business as usual — it's a red flag. Such a change should be
justified. The underlying problem should be identified and addressed:
for example, the assignee might need help or be over-committed; the
team could be under-staffed; or perhaps the task should simply not
have any milestone in the first place.

<a id="tasks-management-assignee"></a>

## Assignee

See [[contribute/working_together/GitLab#assignee]].

<a id="tasks-management-ux-improvements"></a>

## UX improvements

We have a list of
[[!tails_gitlab groups/tails/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=✓&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Core%20Work%3AFoundations%20Team&label_name%5B%5D=UX%3Adebt
desc="UX improvements that qualify as Foundations Team work"]].

When you start working on such an issue:

 - Assign it to yourself.

 - Notify our [[UX designers|roles/ux]] with a `@sajolida` mention on
   the issue: then they can explain what kind of work they have to do
   before you can complete your part of the work.

### Process

Our [[UX designers|roles/ux]] maintain a
[[!tails_gitlab groups/tails/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=✓&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=UX%3Adebt
desc="list of UX improvements"]] that would be welcome,
using the "UX:debt" label.

From time to time, some Foundations Team members meet with UX designers and do
a value/cost analysis of these issues. Then, those with the best value/cost,
that we can work on without waiting for lots of UX design work to be done, are
added to the list of Foundations Team tasks.
