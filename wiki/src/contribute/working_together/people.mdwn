[[!meta title="People"]]

This page will contain the profiles of frequent contributors to Tails. See
[[!tails_ticket 17046]].

Goals of this page include:

- Giving the Tails project a "human face".
- Destroying the myth that contributors to Tails are anonymous.
- Building trust by showing that Tails contributors are real people.
- Documenting the pronouns of contributors.

Contributor profiles on this page will include:

- The contributor's name, handle, or pseudonym.
- A description of the work that the contributor does for Tails.
- The pronouns used by the contributor.

Right now, contributors' pronouns and other information can be found in our
[[!tails_gitlab desc="GitLab"]] by viewing the contributor's GitLab profile or
by hovering over their username. Contributors are encouraged to
[[!tails_gitlab help/user/profile/index.md#add-your-gender-pronouns desc="add their pronouns"]]
to their GitLab profile.

In their profile on this page, contributors can choose to include:

- Their email address.
- Their social media accounts.
- Their PGP key.
- Their picture or avatar.
