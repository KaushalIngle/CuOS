[[!meta title="Marking a task as Starter"]]

We think that having issues labeled *Starter* on GitLab is a great tool
to help new contributors getting into Tails. Here are a few criteria to
help us determine which issues to put in this category.

We want to allow people with very different skills to contribute to
Tails for the first time. Programmers, web designers, documentation writers, or
translators should be able to find tasks that they can complete without
having to acquire a deep knowledge of Tails or to learn how to use tools
that are outside of their field of expertise.

Creating a *Starter* task
=========================

When creating an *Starter* task, try to write a description that is as helpful as
possible to someone who is new to the project:

  - Describe precisely what to achieve and the skills needed.
  - Explicitly link to useful resources (eg. code), information (eg. threads),
    etc.

General
=======

- Not *Starter*:
  - Is blocked by other issues.
  - Needs to be split to be actionable.

Audit & Research
================

- Not *Starter*:
  - Interacts with several subsystems of Tails.

Code
====

- *Starter*:
  - Write a patch that doesn't need to rebuild Tails.
- Not *Starter*:
  - The first solution that comes to your mind is not the right one.
  - Interact with several subsystems of Tails.
  - Rework on a first attempt to code that failed because things were
    more difficult that they seemed at first glance.
  - Have specific hardware for the task.
