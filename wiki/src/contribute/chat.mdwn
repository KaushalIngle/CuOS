[[!meta title="Contributors chat"]]

In addition to the [[tails general chatroom|support/chat]],
we have a dedicated chatroom for contributors.

To join it, use your preferred instant messaging client that supports XMPP, e.g.
[[Pidgin|http://www.pidgin.im/]], which runs on Windows, GNU/Linux and
macOS.

Here are the needed technical details:

* protocol: XMPP
* server: `chat.disroot.org`
* channel: `tails-dev`
* Use TLS/SSL to connect!

To learn more about XMPP or to sign up for a Disroot XMPP account, see the
Disroot page on [chatting with XMPP](https://disroot.org/en/services/xmpp).

<div class="note">

<p>We moved our chatrooms from Riseup to Disroot because Riseup
<a href="https://riseup.net/chat">shut down its XMPP service</a>.</p>
