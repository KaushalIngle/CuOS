[[!meta title="User interviews"]]

We are collecting here summaries and insights from interviews
with Tails users.

For privacy reasons, the name and organization of the interviewees were
changed, the interviews were translated and slightly rephrased, and the
interviewees reviewed the text before publication.

In their shortest form, these can be
[intercept Interviews](http://internetfreedom.secondmuse.com/framework-elements/intercept-interviews/)
that are designed to increase understanding and dialogue through a series of
quick questions that take no more than 10 to 15 minutes of dialogue.

The email address of the interviewees are stored in the internal Git
repo: `contacts/ux_interviews.mdwn`.

The names of the interviewees are changed but loosely related in terms
of gender, language, and age.

Intercept interview script
--------------------------

- Introduction
  - Who I am, what I am doing, and why I'm conducting the interview.

- Getting the interviewee's consent:
  - You can answer my questions to the extend that you feel comfortable
    and stop at any moment.
  - We want to keep this information publicly available for contributors
    of the project but in generic terms, removing personally
    identifiable information.

- The user
  - Who are you? What do you do?

- Tails & you:
  - How did you come to be interested in Tails and get started?
  - What is your level of expertise with Tails?
  - What do you use it for? How often?

- Pros & cons:
  - What are the three things that you like the most in Tails?
  - What are the three things that you dislike the most in Tails?

- Good bye:
  - Thank you!
  - Would you give us your email if you want to keep in touch for future
    questions or go deeper? Emails are stored encrypted and only
    accessible to the core contributors.
  - Do you know of anybody else using Tails and that would be worth
    interviewing?

Tips when taking notes
----------------------

- Whenever possible, try to transcribe the language, mental model, and
  understanding of the interviewee. The interviewee might use a
  different word than what we usual use (for example, "permanent"
  instead of "persistent") or think that something is not possible in
  Tails while it is. Don't correct them during the interview (you can
  clarify things that could be helpful for them at the very end) and
  transcribe this in your summary.

Template email for validating the output

Thank you so much for taking some time to answer my questions about
Tails the other day!

I'm sending you here what I plan to store in our public working
documents on our website. Please correct me if I misunderstood
something or if you want me to remove some bits.
