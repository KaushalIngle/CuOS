[[!meta title="Daan, December 2017"]]

Daan is a 18 years old ICT (information and communications technology)
student and a security researcher. He lives in the Netherlands and
cares a lot about privacy.

He learned about Tails on the Tor website after he started using Tor.
He tried Tails, noticed that everything was routed through Tor by
default and liked it. He also immediately appreciated that
cryptography tools, such as OpenPGP encryption, are readily
accessible. The memory erasure on shutdown feature was another
key point.

Daan is a power-user who themed his Tails and uses additional software
packages. He uses Tails only when he feels it's needed and not daily,
for example when he feels like the government may target him because
he looks up specific information. He uses Tails for penetration
testing, sharing files privately with his friends, and occasionally
for software development.

Things he likes:

1. Memory erasure on shutdown.
2. Access to encryption tools (OpenPGP, KeePassX).
3. No data leaves the computer without going through Tor.

Things he dislikes:

1. He finds the applications menu hard to use (but he likes GNOME).
2. He would like to see [tcpcrypt](http://tcpcrypt.org/) integrated
   in Tails.
3. He finds the Tails user interface glossy and thinks it should
   look fancier.
4. He wants server functionality in Tails.
