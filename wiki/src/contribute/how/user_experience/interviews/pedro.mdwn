[[!meta title="Pedro, May 2017"]]

Pedro is 23 years old and studies applied mathematics in college in
Brazil. He has been a Linux user since 11 years; Qubes OS is now his
main operating system.

He learned about Tails via the homepage of the Tor website before the
Snowden leaks, and got interested by the amnesic property of Tails.
He feels he knows his way around Tails and uses it once or twice
a week to browse hidden services websites and for encrypted chat
(that he finds easier to use on Tails than elsewhere).

### What he likes

- carrying a computer environment in his pocket
- OnionShare
- easy to use, practical
- how the project cares about people and security

### What he dislikes

- GNOME is heavy and slow on old hardware
- the end of 32-bit support
- no more Windows Camouflage
