[[!meta title="Margarita, March 2017"]]

Margarita is a digital security consultant in Latin America. She used to
develop autonomous communication infrastructures and is now focusing on
training human-right defenders and organizations in digital security.
She has been presenting Tails mostly to two different public:

- Family members of missing people. For example working on building
  lists of missing people and DNA databases. People often disappear
  while traveling on roads and, as a consequence, people are sometimes
  refraining from moving. So it's a challenge to transmit information
  from one place to another or to be able to travel without carrying
  sensitive information. For example, someone wanted to train people on
  how to build a list of missing people in a community and decided to
  travel to the community without a computer and only use Tails there.
- Women sharing abortion techniques and resources. They are often women
  who cannot turn to their families to ask questions and look for
  solutions and otherwise go and ask Google.

Things she likes:

- In the case of documenting missing people, they find the learning
  curve worth it.
- It's portable: you keep it in your pocket and you don't have to
  install anything else.

Things she dislikes:

- Tails became harder to boot on newer computers.
- In the case of women sharing abortion techniques, the learning curve
  made it harder to adopt.
