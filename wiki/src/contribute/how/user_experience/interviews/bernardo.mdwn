[[!meta title="Bernardo, May 2017"]]

Bernardo is a 37 years old public administration teacher and social
science researcher in Brazil. He studies the way social movements use
Internet communication tools. He discovered Tails after the Snowden
leaks, via a hackers collective and the homepage of the Tor website.

He uses Debian and GNOME (and has some basic knowledge of the command
line interface) so he felt comfortable using Tails, and found it easy
to get started with. He advocates using Tails and started using it
himself since the coup; he uses it about once a month, primarily to
release and distribute material against the government.

### What he likes

- everything is torified by default
- the amnesic property: everything goes away when turning off the
  computer
- Windows Camouflage (when it was thereâ€¦)
- Pidgin

### What he dislikes

- he had some trouble with the Unsafe Browser
