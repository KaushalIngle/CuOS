[[!meta title="Sophia, May 2017"]]

Sophia is 30 years old, lives in Brazil and has two jobs: she is
a teacher and a system administrator.

In 2015, she was looking for an operating system that would be safer
than macOS, and discovered Tails. She had been using Linux for 2 years
already, but found it vastly easier to use Tails than to configure
software to use Tor on a regular Linux distribution. Since then, Tails
is her only OS and she uses it every day; she feels very comfortable
using it, although she has not tried everything.

### What she likes

- Tails is plug'n'play and it "just works"
- Tor Browser
- MAT

### What she dislikes

- having to configure Tor Browser to match her security requirements
  (security slider set to "High", JavaScript disabled by default)
  every time she starts Tails; she would like a persistent setting
  for these settings
- Totem is buggy with some subtitles (buggy delay after pausing and
  resuming), so she misses VLC
- she misses a set of LibreOffice Impress templates/themes that could
  be installed by default
