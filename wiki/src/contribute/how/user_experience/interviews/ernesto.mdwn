[[!meta title="Ernesto, March 2017"]]

Ernesto is working in the social science department of a University in
Latin America where he does communication, web development, and video.
He is also active in a local hacklab where he has a community TV and
does video editing with free software.

He uses Tails to be able to have a secure access to his personal data
from the work computer that he has at the University or when he wants to
travel light.

Things he likes:

- Have a full OS on a USB stick is cool!
- All the connections go through Tor.
- Keeping his email configuration and encryption keys in the persistent
  storage.
- Tails comes with everything you need already. It even has a video
  editor.
- He liked meeting the developers in person and seeing that we share
  similar ways of doing things. Now he wonders how he could help back.

Things he dislikes:

- The fact the upgrade mechanism is sometimes automatic and sometimes
  manual. You never know what to expect.
- The new installation instructions are good for new users but he feels
  a bit lost when looking for the command line instructions only.
