*WireframeSketcher*
===================

[*WireframeSketcher*](https://wireframesketcher.com/) is a proprietary
tool to create wireframes. It's super easy to learn, super fast to use
and works from Tails!

<div class="caution">

<p><span class="application">WireframeSketcher</span> being proprietary
software, you are not allowed to install it on your Tails if you have to
comply with most of the security policies of our internal teams. You
should install it on a dedicated Tails without sensitive
information.</p>

</div>

To install *WireframeSketcher* in Tails, execute:

    wget https://wireframesketcher.com/downloads/WireframeSketcher-latest_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i WireframeSketcher-latest_amd64.deb
    sudo apt-get -f install --yes

In the *generic* folder, you can find reusable wireframes and icons for
GNOME and Tails, like the desktop or *Files*:
