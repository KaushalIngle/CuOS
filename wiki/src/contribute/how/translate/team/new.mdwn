[[!meta title="Translate Tails website into a new language"]]

There are already some active website translation teams,
coordinating via the [[mailing list for translators|translate#follow-up]].

So, you want the Tails website to be available in a new language.
Please keep in mind that it represents quite a lot of work.

Therefore, here are a few things that would be required in order to start
translating the Tails website to a new language:

1. A team of translators, not just one person, is necessary.
   This allows for peer reviews between team members. It also makes it
   easier to handle both scheduled and unexpected deadlines.

2. At least part of the team should subscribe to the [[mailing list
   for translators|translate#follow-up]].

3. For translations to be useful, they need to be maintained in the
   long run. This takes a few hours a month.

Once those conditions are fulfilled, the new team can start working on a first
batch of translations:

  - The Tails custom programs, as [[documented earlier|translate#translate]]

  - See the list of [[core pages|l10n_tricks/core_po_files.txt]] of our website.

This may take some time. Don't get discouraged! Along the way, do not
hesitate to report about your progress, and to ask for help, on the
[[mailing list for translators|translate#follow-up]] :)

As soon as the translations of core pages reach 25%, you can ask on
the mailing list for your language to be enabled on the website. If
the translations go below 25% later, it will be disabled from the
website. When the core pages are completely translated, you can start
translating other parts of the website. It is also good to translate
the news and release announcements.

Finally, in order to ease collaboration and to make it easier to join
you, the new team should document what glossaries it uses, and what
Git repositories are used by its members (see e.g. the [[French
translation team's documentation|translate/team/fr]]).
