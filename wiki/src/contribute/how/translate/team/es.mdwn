# How to join the Spanish translation team?

We have one main communication channel: the **[mailing
list](https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-l10n-spanish)**.
Is important to join the list so we can organize together.
This list has a low volume of messages and is the place to solve your doubts or
share your ideas with other translators. Please introduce yourself to the list
when joining.

You can also join the [localization mailing list for all languages](https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-l10n)

# How to translate

* We try to translate using Tails itself so we get familiarised with the
  software we are translating.
* We use the [weblate translation platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/)
  to translate the website. **Please read this [[introduction
  |with_Translation_platform]] before translating**.
* We have a wiki for the Spanish team, **please read it before translating**:
  [[!tails_blueprint l10n_Spanish]] to prevent the most common translation
  errors.
