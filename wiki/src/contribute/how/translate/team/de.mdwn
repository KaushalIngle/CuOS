[[!meta title="Translate Tails into German"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

Currently there is no fixed team of German translators. If you want
to start translating to German (which would be really appreciated, by
the way!) there are some pointers:

* The easiest way of translating **this website** is by using
  [[the Tails translation platform|translate/with_translation_platform/]].
  It is also possible to [[translate with Git|translate/with_Git]] but
  it is probably harder to find someone to review the changes.

* The **Tails custom programs** are translated using
  [[Transifex|translate/with_Transifex]].

# Glossaries used by the German translation team

We try to follow the [GNOME Guidelines](https://wiki.gnome.org/de/Uebersetzung)
and their glossaries:

* <https://wiki.gnome.org/de/StandardUebersetzungen>
* <https://wiki.gnome.org/de/Uebersetzung/Dokumentationen>

As well as the Transifex glossary of the Torproject (you need to be logged in with
Transifex to see this page):

* <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/glossary/l/de/>

For words not in these lists it is helpful to see
how they are translated (or not translated) in Wikipedia.

Often, we simply discuss on the [[mailing list for
translators|https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-l10n/]] if
unsure which term applies best.
