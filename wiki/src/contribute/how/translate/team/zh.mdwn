# How to join the Chinese translation team?

New contributors should first subscribe to the [[mailing list for
translators|https://www.autistici.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-l10n/]] and
introduce themselves to the Chinese team on the list.

We currently work in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese and use
`opencc` to convert our work between the two writing systems.

# How to translate into Chinese

An introduction on how to translate can be found on jxtai's blog,
written in traditional Chinese
[https://blog.jxtsai.info/2017/08/04/about-tails-l10n/](https://blog.jxtsai.info/2017/08/04/about-tails-l10n/).

# What can be translated

* **This website** is translated with the [Tails translation
  platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/). Read an introduction about it
  [[here|with_translation_platform/]].

* Website [core pages to
  translate](https://github.com/twngo/Tails-zh_TW/wiki/core_to_translate)

* The Chinese team does not use Git to **translate Tails custom programs**.
  Instead, and for this part only, we rely on [[Transifex|translate/with_Transifex]].

# Glossaries used by the Chinese translation team

The Chinese team uses [Torproject's
glossary](https://www.transifex.com/otf/torproject/glossary/zh_CN/)

# Contributors' repositories

* jxtsai: [[https://github.com/twngo/tails/]] (traditional Chinese)
