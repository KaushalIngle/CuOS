[[!meta title="Configuration of the production website"]]

Whenever you work on our website or documentation, you may need to
modify our ikiwiki configuration. You need to do so in three different
places:

 - The [[!tails_gitweb ikiwiki.setup]] configuration file that lives
   in our main Git repository is used primarily for building the
   offline copy of the website that is included in every Tails
   release.

 - Our live, [production website](https://tails.boum.org/) uses its
   own configuration file which is managed differently.

These configuration files must be updated in a coordinated way,
otherwise one can easily break our production website. Here is how to
do so:

1. When submitting a merge request with website changes that require
   ikiwiki configuration changes:
   - Apply these configuration changes to `ikiwiki.setup`
     and include them in your merge request.
   - Make it clear to the reviewer that merging your MR must
     be coordinated with
     [[contribute/working_together/roles/sysadmins]].

2. `git clone https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/puppet-tails.git` and apply the
   same changes to the ikiwiki configuration used by our production
   website:
   - [[!tails_gitweb_puppet_tails templates/website/ikiwiki.setup.epp]]
   - [[!tails_gitweb_puppet_tails manifests/website/params.pp]]
   - [[!tails_gitweb_puppet_tails files/website/ikiwiki-libdir/IkiWiki/Plugin/sidebar2.pm]]

3. Submit these production website configuration changes to the
   [[sysadmins team|contribute/working_together/roles/sysadmins]],
   as a merge request. Make it clear that
   applying these changes must be coordinated with the person who is
   responsible for merging the other MR that you've proposed
   for the main Tails Git repository.
