[[!meta title="About Javascript on our website"]]

We use JavaScript to the minimum while always ensuring graceful
degradation.

Arguments against using JavaScript:

  - JavaScript can be dangerous for security and privacy. Tor Browser is
    supposed to block all JavaScript that might harm anonymity.
    But some of the JavaScript allowed by Tor Browser can still be dangerous.
  - An important part of our audience wants to be careful about
    JavaScript, for the reason mentioned above, and might disable it
    fully. To support this use case, we include the NoScript extension.
    So, to be coherent with this, every part of our website must be
    functional without JavaScript. This also ensures compatibility with
    all the levels of the security slider of Tor Browser ([[!tor_bug
    9387]]).
  - We don't know much about JavaScript ourselves, and even less about
    JavaScript security. So writing JavaScript seems complicated,
    costly, and error-prone. Reusing JavaScript libraries like jQuery
    looks more feasible without taking much risks.

Arguments in favor of using JavaScript:

  - We are already using JavaScript on our website (see the toggle on
    the old download page).
  - JavaScript might allow us to present better our information to some
    users and improve the experience of navigating on our website.
    But using it to save us a bit of work or look cool might
    not be a good enough reason.
