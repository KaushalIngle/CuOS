[[!meta title="Containerized setup of Weblate in Tails' Translation Platform"]]

Verification of the integrity of the source code of Weblate and its
dependencies was a concern since the beginning of this project, as compromise
of that piece would mean compromise of the Tails documentation/website. That
concern initially led to the decision of not relying on Pypi as a source of
packages, which made upgrade and maintenance of the installation more
difficult, as we then needed a new/separate way of resolving dependencies and
fetching source code.

With time it became clear that the speed of Weblate releases was much faster
than Tails' sysadmins capacity of upgrading and maintaining the platform
up-to-date. This led to the decision of redesigning the platform to use a
containerized Weblate application as provided by upstream.

Our [current Puppet code for the translation
platform](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/puppet-tails/-/tree/master/manifests/weblate)
is a result of that process and, when applied, will setup Weblate from a
container using [Podman](https://podman.io/) and configure the environment
around it to provide the other parts of the Translation Platform.

Trusted sources
===============

By using Weblate's upstream container, we are effectively trusting all parties
involved in building and distributing that container to provide the source code
as intended by the developers of Weblate and each of its dependencies.

What follows is a list of actors involved in the build and distribution chain
of the Weblate container and may need to be revisited when/if upstream changes
its process:

* The [Debian container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian) is used as a
  [base for the Weblate container
  image](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/docker/blob/ec67a204e8e22a233d47f5177ea37cb8159568bf/Dockerfile#L1).

* Some Python dependencies are installed from
  [Debian](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/docker/blob/ec67a204e8e22a233d47f5177ea37cb8159568bf/Dockerfile#L64)
  (build dependencies, mainly, but also pycairo and maybe others).

* Pip and Wheel are installed from
  [Pypi](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/docker/blob/ec67a204e8e22a233d47f5177ea37cb8159568bf/Dockerfile#L110).

* Weblate and its requirements are all downloaded from
  [Pypi](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/docker/blob/ec67a204e8e22a233d47f5177ea37cb8159568bf/Dockerfile#L122).

* Builds are automated in
  [GitHub](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/docker/runs/2938139897?check_suite_focus=true#step:6:55).

* Uploads to docker.io (Docker Hub) are also automated in
  [GitHub](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/docker/runs/2938978602?check_suite_focus=true#step:9:848).

* The container image is distributed through [Docker
  Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/weblate/weblate).

Administrative commands
=======================

Please note that the `weblate` user in the host system (UID `2000000` in
`translate.lizard`) corresponds to the `root` user inside the Weblate
container (UID `0`).

Also, some of the commands below have to be executed in a directory readable to
the user `weblate` in the host system (eg. `/tmp` or `/var/lib/weblate`).

To start, stop or restart the container, use Systemd with the `--user` flag:

       sudo -u weblate XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/2000000 systemctl --user stop podman-weblate

To see the container logs:

       sudo -u weblate podman logs -f --tail=1 weblate

To get a shell as the `weblate` user in the running Weblate container:

       sudo -u weblate podman exec -t -i weblate /bin/bash

To get a shell as the `root` user in the running Weblate container:

       sudo -u weblate podman exec -t -i --user=root weblate /bin/bash

To see the logs of the integration script:

       sudo -u weblate tail -f /var/log/weblate/update.log

To run the integration script (note that this is run periodically by cron):

       sudo -u weblate /var/lib/weblate/scripts/run_in_container.sh /scripts/cron.sh

To run permissions enforcement (note that this is run periodically by cron):

       sudo -u weblate /var/lib/weblate/scripts/run_in_container.sh /scripts/weblate_permissions.py --enforce

To update the translation memory database (note that this is run periodically by cron):

       sudo -u weblate /var/lib/weblate/scripts/update_tm.sh

To see Apache logs (replace `access` with `error` on the line below to see the
corresponding error logs):

       sudo /usr/bin/tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
