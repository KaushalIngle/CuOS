[[!meta title="Memory erasure"]]

In order to protect against memory recovery such as cold boot attack,
most of the system RAM is overwritten when Tails is being shutdown or when the
boot medium is physically removed. Also, memory allocated to processes
is erased upon process termination.

#### The big picture

Tails now relies on the Linux kernel's freed memory poisoning feature.

But memory poisoning only works when memory is actually freed,
and a regular shutdown would not free the memory used by the overlayfs
read-write branch. So we use the `systemd-shutdown` ability to return
to the initramfs, to ensure the root filesystem is unmounted.

The initramfs is unpacked in `/run/initramfs` at boot time:

 * [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system/initramfs-shutdown.service]]
 * [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/initramfs-restore]]
 * [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/udev-watchdog-wrapper]]

â€¦ so that the copy of `systemd-shutdown` that runs in the real,
non-initramfs system can switch root into `/run/initramfs`, and run
another copy of `systemd-shutdown` that's
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/shutdown desc="included"]]
in the initramfs. That one will unmount all filesystems, run
[[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/initramfs-pre-shutdown-hook desc="a custom hook"]]
that helps us automatically test this behavior, and finally perform
the requested poweroff/reboot action.

To make this work, a dedicated `tmpfs` filesystem is [[!tails_gitweb
config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system/run-initramfs.mount
desc="mounted"]] on `/run/initramfs`: `/run` is mounted with the
`noexec` option and while our attempts to remount it with `exec`
worked for clean shutdown, they failed for emergency shutdown, i.e.
when the boot medium is physically removed.

For details about the underlying systemd mechanisms, see:

 - `bootup(7)`
 - `systemd-shutdown(8)`
 - <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/InitrdInterface/>

In our experience, jumping back to the initramfs to unmount the remaining
filesystems, as described above, was necessary but not sufficient to free the
memory used by the overlayfs read-write branch. That's why additionally, we
manually delete the content of that branch via [[!tails_gitweb
config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system/tails-remove-overlayfs-dirs.service
desc="a systemd service"]] late in the shutdown process, before we jump back to
the initramfs. It's unclear to us why this works when the boot medium
is physically removed: in that case, `systemctl --force poweroff`
is _not_ supposed to stop `tails-remove-overlayfs-dirs.service`, and thus
this additional clean up step should be skipped; it could be that in this
emergency shutdown situation, `systemd-shutdown` somehow manages to clean
things up by itself and there's no need for `tails-remove-overlayfs-dirs.service`.

#### Triggers

Different kinds of events trigger the memory erasure process. All lead
to run the shutdown process that erases memory.

**First, most memory is erased at the end of a normal shutdown/reboot
sequence.** This is implemented by the [[Linux kernel's freed memory
poisoning feature|design/kernel_hardening]], more specifically:

* `page_poison`
* passing "P" to `slub_debug`
* zeroing heap memory at free time (`init_on_free=1`)

[[!tails_gitweb features/erase_memory.feature desc="Automated tests"]]
ensure that the most important parts of memory are erased this way.

**Second, the memory erasure process is triggered when the boot medium
is physically removed during runtime (USB boot medium is unplugged or
boot DVD is ejected).** This is implemented by a custom `udev-watchdog`
program monitors the boot medium; it's run by a wrapper, started at
boot time, that brutally invokes the memory erasure process, bypassing
other system shutdown scripts, when this medium happens to be
physically removed.

Note that the `udev-watchdog` is disabled while the system is suspended to RAM,
in order to avoid a race condition when resuming from suspend, which used to
occasionally trigger the emergency shutdown (see [[!tails_ticket 11729]]).
This means that the memory erasure process is not triggered if the boot
medium is removed while the system is suspended.

- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/usr/src/udev-watchdog.c]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-hooks/52-udev-watchdog]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system/tails-shutdown-on-media-removal.service]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-hooks/52-update-rc.d]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system/gdm.service.d/restart.conf]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system-sleep/toggle-tails-shutdown-on-media-removal.sh]]

#### Making sure needed files are available

The `memlockd` daemon, appropriately configured, ensures every file
needed by the memory erasure process is locked into memory from boot
to memory erasure time.

- [[!debpts memlockd]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/etc/memlockd.cfg]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-patches/keep_memlockd_on_shutdown.diff]]
- [[!tails_gitweb config/chroot_local-includes/lib/systemd/system/memlockd.service.d/oom.conf]]

#### Limitations

As discussed in
an email thread
with the authors of `PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE`, kernel memory poisoning
does not clear _all_ kinds of memory once it's freed:

 * we enable free poisoning for the buddy allocator, the slub/slab
   ones, and heap memory, but there may be other ways the Linux kernel allocates
   memory, that are not subject to poisoning;
 * on shutdown all process memory is freed (and thus erased), but some
   kernel memory is not erased on shutdown, and is currently
   not erased.

It's not obvious that our previous approaches (see below) did any
better, and this one is much more reliable, so we think this trade-off
is the most sensible one with the resources and skills currently
available for Tails.

#### Obsolete approaches

The initial implementation of the Tails memory erasure feature
suffered from flaws that were demonstrated by [[external
audit|security/audits/Blackhat_De-Anonymizing_Live_CDs]]. In short, it
only erased free memory and let data in the union filesystem read-write branch in
recoverable state.

Then, in order to erase the biggest possible part of the system memory,
a new implementation, shipped from Tails 0.7 to 2.12, runs in a
fresh environment provided by a newly started Linux kernel. This way,
a given part of the memory either is *used* by the memory erasure
process itself or it is considered as free and thus *erased* by this
process; in any case, it is at least overwritten once.

Sadly, this approach suffered from severe usability and reliability
problems (e.g. [[!tails_ticket 12354]], [[!tails_ticket 11786]]).
So it was removed in Tails 3.0.
