<p>These personas are fictitious but concrete representations of the people
using Tails. We use these personas to keep in mind who we are working for, what
are their needs, and what Tails should do for them.</p>

<p>These personas come from collective discussions about who we want to help
when building Tails, [[interviews with users|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews]], and other
sources of information about Internet freedom.</p>

<h1>Archive of the process</h1>

<h2>Comments and prioritization (August 2018)</h2>

<p>Based on the skeletons drafted in 2018, we created posters to illustrate our
draft personas:</p>

<a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/ux/-/raw/master/personas/2018-08/posters.pdf">
<img src="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/ux/-/raw/master/personas/2018-08/posters.png"/>
</a>

<p>We asked 14 contributors to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Comment on the personas</li>

<li>Prioritize which personas we should focus on the most in the short-term
(1-3 years). For example, in terms of:

<ul>
<li>Frequency of use: How often would each persona use Tails?</li>
<li>Audience size: How many people could each persona represent?</li>
<li>Benefit for the project: Which of these persona could (or did) bring benefit to the project (money, contributions, outreach, etc.)?</li>
<li>Readiness: How mature is Tails to help each of these persona?</li>
<li>Strategy: Do you think that focusing on some of these personas would be more strategic for some other reason?</li>
<li>Any other criteria?</li>
</ul>

<p>By assigning points to each of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a total of 100 points.</li>
<li>Assign points to each persona to reflect its priority.</li>
<li>You cannot give the same number of points to two personas.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/ux/-/raw/master/personas/2018-08/prioritization.fods">From
this prioritization</a>, we decided that focusing on Riou was slightly more
important to us than focusing on Cris and Kim, and that Derya was the less
important of the 4.</p>

</li></ul>

<h2>Skeletons and comments (April&ndash;July 2018)</h2>

<p>From the user goals identified in 2017, we drafted 4 skeletons and asked the
community to comment on them during our monthly meetings in

<h2>Collective process to identity user goals (August 2017)</h2>

<p>Summary of a 2 hours session with 12 core contributors.</p>

<p>This process is inspired by the workshop described in <u>The Essential
Persona Lifecycle</u> by Tamara Adlin and John Pruitt, Chapter 4 <i>Persona
conception and gestation</i>.</p>

<ul>
<li>General explanation of what personas are and why they are useful (15')</li>

<li>Everybody prepares, in silent, sticky notes describing a user and their goal. (15')

    <p>For example:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>"Women that go through domestic violence and wants to escape from that."</li>
    <li>"Webmasters of a sensitive website that wants to hack on it."</li>
    </ul></li>

<li><p>All together we assimilate these sticky notes and the ones identified
in August 2016 by <em>types of users</em>. (30')</p>

<p>We start with predefined categories based on last year's output and
  adding new ones or splitting existing ones as needed. There should be
  no more than 10 stick notes per category.</p>

<ul>
<li>Predefined categories:
  <ul>
  <li>Activist</li>
  <li>Censorship evader</li>
  <li>Contributor</li>
  <li>Darknet customer</li>
  <li>Information freedom fighter</li>
  <li>Nomadic</li>
  <li>Privacy geek</li>
  <li>Surveilled at home</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>Final categories:
  <ul>
  <li>Activist</li>
  <li>Censorship evader</li>
  <li>Contributor</li>
  <li>Darknet customer</li>
  <li>Evil people</li>
  <li>Information freedom fighter</li>
  <li>Journalist or researcher</li>
  <li>Law enforcement</li>
  <li>Nomadic</li>
  <li>People helping others in shit</li>
  <li>People we don't want to help</li>
  <li>Privacy geek</li>
  <li>Sensitive content creator</li>
  <li>Surveilled at home</li>
  <li>Surveilled at work</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<li>The facilitator takes pictures of the resulting assimilation and
  removes the user categories.</li>

<li>All together we assimilate again the same stick notes and group them
  by <em>user goals</em> (45').

  <p>User goals are short sentences starting with "<em>I want...</em>" or "<em>I need...</em>".
  There should be no more than 10 stick notes per category. Sticky notes
  that fit in more than one goal can be duplicated.</p></li>

<li> All together we summarize these goals by identifying main goals and
  subgoals. (10')

  <p>See "[[User goals for using Tails|personas#user-goals]]" above.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Collective brainstorming of uses of Tails (August 2016)</h2>

<li>Union workers use Tails to coordinate about labor struggle over their company's network.</li>
<li>A Russian tourist uses Tails to access their online bank account without getting their credential stolen.</li>
<li>A nomadic person with no personal laptop uses Tails to carry the same computing environment and personal documents around.</li>

<li>A person without their own Internet access uses Tails to use an uncensored Internet.</li>
<li>A teenager uses Tails to escape parental control filter.</li>
<li>A group of people use Tails to write a book together and publish it.</li>
<li>A scientist uses Tails to report and transcribe interviews while preserving the personal identifying information of the interviewees.</li>
<li>Webmasters of a cop-watching website use Tails to reduce their chance of being caught while reporting on police violence.</li>
<li>A photographer uses Tails to store and work on pictures before publication.</li>
<li>A person without the need for a big storage uses Tails as their main operating system to have more privacy.</li>
</ul>
