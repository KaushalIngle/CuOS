# What can be reimbursed

As a Tails worker or regular contributor, Tails can reimburse:

- small hardware expenses
- big hardware expenses

as long as they are needed to do your Tails work.

Tails also reimburses:

- travel to and from Tails meetings

## Small hardware expenses

You do not need pre-approval for small hardware expenses, like
buying a new USB stick. See below for how to claim your expenses.

## Big hardware expenses

You need to ask for pre-approval for big hardware expenses, like
buying a laptop. See below for how to ask for pre-approval and how to
claim your expenses.

## Getting reimbursed when attending Tails meetings

Before attending Tails meetings (work sprints, summit) you will receive
corresponding information about travel tickets and reimbursements from
the accounting team or the sprint organizer.

# Ask for pre-approval of a big expense

If you plan to buy a laptop or make another big expense, you need to ask
the [[Board|about/contact#board]] for pre-approval. To do this, send an email with:

- planned expense: description of item, amount
- short explanation of why you need to make this expense
- tell us if you want Tails to cover the costs entirely or, if you will
  use it also for other work, if you want us to cover only parts of the
  expense
- if you can: remind us if Tails has already paid for the same expense
  in the past and when

Expect a reply in 2-4 weeks.

# Claim your expenses

When you have spent money on behalf of Tails and want to be
reimbursed, you need to send an expense report and the corresponding
receipts to the accounting team.

## Proofs to provide

Your proofs of expenses might be sent to our fiscal sponsor, their tax
office, or our funders. If that's a problem for you, please get in touch
with <tails-accounting@boum.org> before spending your own money.

- **If the amount of the expense is under 150€**

  You can send us a simple receipt without the name of the buyer, for
  example a supermarket receipt or the screenshot of the confirmation of
  an online purchase.

  It's better if you can send us the original paper or digital receipt.

- **If the amount of the expense is 150€ or more**

  You have to send us a legal invoice on the name of one of our fiscal
  sponsors, either:

      Riseup Labs
      P.O. box 4282
      Seattle, WA 98194
      USA

  or

      Center for the Cultivation of Technology gGmbH
      Gottschedstrasse 4
      13357 Berlin
      Germany

## How to claim your expenses

To get your expenses reimbursed, follow these steps in the following
order:

<div class="caution">
Big hardware expenses need to be claimed within 10 days.
</div>

1. Gather all the proofs of expense as explained in "What documents we
   need".

2. Ask the accounting team where to send your paper proofs, or send the
   digital receipts by email (see next step).

3. Send one single email to <tails-accounting@boum.org> with:

     - a detailed list of your receipts ("expense report") with for each:

        * Date of payment / Date of receipt
        * Description of item
        * Amount paid (convert to Euros using the rate of the day you paid
          the item)

     - total sum to be reimbursed if you send several receipts
     - for any expense that has no paper trail: the digital documents
       used as proofs;
     - if relevant, a pointer to the expense pre-approval;
     - how you want to be reimbursed, if we don't already have your
       banking details;
