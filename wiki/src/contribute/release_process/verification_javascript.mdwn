[[!meta title="Releasing updates to the verification JavaScript"]]

We run this release process before releasing a new version of Forge or a change
in the [[verification JavaScript|install/inc/js/download.js]] that is used on
our download pages.

<div class="caution">

<p>During the release process, you will download several pieces of software over
TLS only which is not trustworthy enough to be compliant with the "third-party
software" requirement of the security policy of some of our internal teams.</p>

<p>You should isolate these pieces of software, for example by only running them
in a dedicated Tails.</p>

Which browsers to test
----------------------

Perform the following steps for each of:

  - Tor Browser in the latest Tails, in a non-English locale of your choice:

        LANG=pt_BR.UTF-8 tor-browser

  - The version of Firefox available in Debian stable:

        sudo apt install firefox-esr
        firefox-esr

  - The version of Chromium available in Debian stable:

        sudo apt install chromium
        chromium --no-sandbox

Steps
-----

1. In Tails, configure a system proxy:

   Settings → Network → Network proxy → Manual

   Socks Host:	127.0.0.1	9050

1. Check that verifying the USB image of the last Tails version works in all browsers.

1. Check that verifying a truncated USB image fails in all browsers:

       dd if=tails-amd64-3.14.img of=tails-amd64-3.14-truncated.img bs=1M count=100

1. Check that verifying a rogue USB image fails in all browser:

       sed 's/\x54\x61\x69\x6c\x73/\x46\x61\x69\x6c\x73/' tails-amd64-3.14.img > tails-amd64-3.14-rogue.img

1. To detect backward incompatible changes,
   if any changes were made to the HTML or CSS, verify that the new
   download page works with the previous version of the
   `wiki/src/install/inc/js/download.js`.

   Otherwise, fix the incompatibility or rename the new JavaScript file
   as `wiki/src/install/inc/js/download-2.js`.

   See our discussion about [deploying backward incompatible
   changes](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/16091#note_159623)
   on GitLab.
