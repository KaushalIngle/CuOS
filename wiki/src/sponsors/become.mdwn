Welcome, we're glad to see you interested in becoming a sponsor!
It's thanks to the substantial support of our sponsors that we are able to maintain
and improve Tails.

Become a sponsor

To become a sponsor, you must make a monetary or in-kind donation of at
least $1&#8239;000.

In-kind donations can be for hardware, travel sponsorship, pro bono consulting,
etc.

Your donation might be tax-deductible
=====================================

We have two non-profit fiscal sponsors:

Please verify with your local fiscal administration which of them
would make your donation tax-deductible.
