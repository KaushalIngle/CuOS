The `openntpd` package is not installed anymore since commit
bf8cc787ce46e9946ab47d5383feb1174da3f22a (20091006). The `ntpd` user
is then non-existent on built amnesia systems.

This user is however mentioned in `/etc/firewall.conf`.
`iptables-restore` being apparently picky about imperfect
configuration files, it refuses to load it, and the firewall-level Tor
enforcement is therefore not effective.

# Impact

Some applications establish direct connections through the Internet,
not using the Tor network at all.

Details:

* iceweasel is not affected, thanks to the torbutton extension
* applications that take into account the relevant environment
  variables (namely `http_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `SOCKS_SERVER` and
  `SOCKS5_SERVER`) are not affected
* any other application, such as Pidgin or Thunderbird, is probably
  affected.

# Solution

This problem has been fixed in [[Git|contribute/git]] commit 9c425e8de13e6b4f885.

# Affected versions

No released amnesia version is affected.
