A [critical vulnerability](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2020-49/)
was discovered in the JavaScript engine of *Firefox* and *Tor Browser*.

Until Tails 4.13 (November 17), we recommend all users to set the
[[security level of *Tor
Browser*|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#security-level]] to *Safer*
or *Safest*.

This vulnerability was discovered during the [Tianfu Cup 2020 International
Cybersecurity Contest](http://www.tianfucup.com/). The details of the vulnerability
were not disclosed.

We are not aware of any use of this vulnerability against actual users.

The *Safer* or *Safest* security level of *Tor Browser* are not affected
because the feature of JavaScript that is affected, the *[[!wikipedia
just-in-time compilation]]*, is disabled at these security levels.

Mozilla fixed this vulnerability in *Firefox* 78.4.1 and Tor fixed this
vulnerability in *Tor Browser* 10.0.4.

We decided not to release an emergency upgrade of Tails because:

- Tails 4.13 is already scheduled for November 17 and will fix this
  vulnerability.
- Our main release manager left the team recently and we have very
  limited staffpower right now.
- The details of the vulnerability were not disclosed, making it harder
  to exploit, and we are not aware of any use of this vulnerability
  against actual users.
