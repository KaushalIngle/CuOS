<div class="tip">

<p>This security issue was fixed in Tails 0.9.</p>

</div>

The version of Tor
currently shipped in Tails does not protect your anonymity as it should.
**This vulnerability is critical.**

Until a future version of Tails is released (soon), the only way to
have Tails protect your anonymity is to **upgrade Tor every time you
start Tails**, by following the instructions bellow.

(Every time, really? Sure. Tails is amnesic: any change you make in it
is lost upon restart.)

To upgrade Tor, start a *Root Terminal* from the
*Applications* → *Accessories* menu, and type the following command in
there:

	apt-get update && apt-get install tor && service tor start

... then type *Enter*, and wait until the upgrade is completed, which
may take a few minutes. At this time, the Vidalia icon on the top
right of the screen should have changed from the usual green onion to
a grey, red-crossed one. Right click on it and choose *Exit* in the
menu that opens. Then, start a new Vidalia from the
*Applications* → *Internet* menu.

Once this is done, you can safely use Tails as usual.
