[[!meta date="Mon, 31 Jan 2011 20:40:19 +0100"]]

During the [2011 DC
edition](http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-dc-11/bh-dc-11-home.html) of the
Blackhat conference, [Andrew
Case](http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-dc-11/bh-dc-11-speaker_bios.html#Case) did a
presentation about his research on [de-anonymization of Live
CDs](http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-dc-11/bh-dc-11-briefings.html#Case) through
forensics techniques applied to the system memory content, which mostly
concerned T(A)ILS itself. Some parts of it were also talking about memory
analysis of Tor itself.

The disclosure of this attack leads to a better implementation of the
smem feature in Tails, using kexec to ensure every non-kernel bit of
the memory is wiped; this new implementation is shipped in Tails 0.7
and later. Implementation of automatic memory wiping [[!tails_ticket 5687
desc="when the live media is removed"]],
also shipped as of Tails 0.7, also helps defeating it, at least in the
case this attack takes place when someone's home is raided.
