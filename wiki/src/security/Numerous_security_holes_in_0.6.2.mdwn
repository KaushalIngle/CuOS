The following security holes affect Tails 0.6.2.

We **strongly** urge you to [[upgrade to Tails 0.7|news/version_0.7]]
in case you are still using an older version.

# Incomplete "erase memory on shutdown" feature

As an [[external audit
demonstrated|security/audits/Blackhat_De-Anonymizing_Live_CDs]], the
"erase memory on shutdown" feature, as implemented in Tails 0.6.2 and
older, does not erase as much memory as it could. More specifically:

1. Parts of the memory that are still allocated at shutdown time are
   not erased and can be recovered after shutdown; this includes the
   entire in-memory filesystem (associated meta-data, content of files
   created or modified since boot).
2. Partial recovery of deleted file names and their meta-data is also
   possible.

This discovery lead to a brand new implementation of the memory
erasure feature that is shipped in Tails 0.7. As a bonus, the memory
is now also erased when the boot media is physically removed.
