The following security holes affect Tails 0.7. Some of these allow
**remote arbitrary code execution with full administrator rights**,
that can be exploited by any attacker with access to the local
network.

We **strongly** urge you to [[upgrade to Tails 0.7.1|news/version_0.7.1]]
as soon as possible in case you are still using an older version.
