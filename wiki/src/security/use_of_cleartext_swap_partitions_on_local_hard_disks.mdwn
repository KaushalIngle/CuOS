At least until its version 1.157.4-1, `live-initramfs` has
a [bug](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2009/09/msg00125.html)
that makes it use any cleartext swap partition found on local
hard disks.

# Impact

Any kind of information about the user's activities can be stored on
the local hard disks of the computers being used with affected
amnesia systems.

# Mitigation of passed effects

It is recommended to securely erase, using a program such as `shred`,
any cleartext Linux swap partition present on computers having been
used with affected amnesia systems.

# Solution

We fixed this hole on 20091006 (commit 00c1ff633e8958d0233) by
installing a custom fixed `live-initramfs` package into built images.

The relevant patch was then
[integrated](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2009/10/msg00124.html)
in upstream's Git.

# Affected versions

Releases 0.2-20090815 and 0.2-20090816 are affected, as well as any
custom image built from Git before commit 00c1ff633e8958d0233.
