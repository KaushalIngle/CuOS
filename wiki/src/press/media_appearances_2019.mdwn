  Twitter](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1165395796520554496):

  <em>“In 2013, when a small team of journalists and I went head to
  head against @NSAGov to reveal the secret system of global mass
  surveillance, we used @Tails_Live to communicate—to reduce the risk
  of basic but deadly mistakes.<br/>
  The NSA only learned of our plan when it hit the news.”</em>

  <em>“If you look at the way post-2013 whistleblowers have been caught,
  it is clear the absolute most important thing you can do to maintain
  your anonymity is reduce the number of places in your operational
  activity where you can make mistakes. Tor and Tails still do precisely
  that.”</em>
