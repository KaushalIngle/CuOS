  and encryption. And it's just really secure. [...] So, it's a really important

  by Trevor Timm:
  - Laura Poitras says: "I've been reluctant to go into details about
    the different steps I took to communicate securely with Snowden to
    avoid those methods being targeted. Now that Tails gives a green
    light, I can say it has been an essential tool for reporting the
    NSA story. It is an all-in-one secure digital communication system
    (GPG email, OTR chat, Tor web browser, encrypted storage) that is
    small enough to swallow. I'm very thankful to the Tails developers
    for building this tool."
  - Glenn Greenwald says: "Tails have been vital to my ability to work
    securely on the NSA story. The more I've come to learn about
    communications security, the more central Tails has become to
    my approach."
  - Barton Gellman says: "Privacy and encryption work, but it's too
    easy to make a mistake that exposes you. Tails puts the essential
    tools in one place, with a design that makes it hard to screw them
    up. I could not have talked to Edward Snowden without this kind of
    protection. I wish I'd had it years ago."

  case is journalists trying to communicate or work in environments in which
  they may normally be at risk or compromised. The NSA stories have been the
