Welcome to the very first edition of this newsletter!

We'll let you know what your donations from last year made possible in 2021,
share information for you to make the most out of Tails, and let you know about
our plans for the coming months.

Please let us know if this newsletter doesn't display correctly, so we can
improve next time.

Tor Connection assistant
========================

From the feedback that we receive from users around the world, we knew, that
connecting to Tor from Tails was problematic for our most vulnerable users:
whistleblowers surveilled at work, domestic violence survivors surveilled at
home, and people who use Tails to circumvent nationwide censorship, especially
in Asia.

That's why we added a *Tor Connection* assistant to make it easier for them to
connect to the Tor network in Tails 4.20 (July 13).

Despite all the work done on this feature since February, we received several
reports from people who are not able to connect to Tor anymore. Unfortunately,
the 3 beta versions that we published since April were not enough to detect
these problems before the release. We are making it our top priority to fix as
many of these bugs as possible in time for 4.21 (August 10).

This first release of the *Tor Connection* assistant is only a first step. We
will add more improvements to it in Tails 4.22 (September 7):

- Save Tor bridges to the Persistent Storage ([[!tails_ticket 5461]])

- Help detect when Wi-Fi is not working ([[!tails_ticket 14534]])

- Synchronize the clock to make it easier to use Tor bridges in Asia
  ([[!tails_ticket 15548]])

Persistent Storage redesign
===========================

The next big change in Tails will be a redesign of the Persistent Storage.
This ongoing work is entirely funded by the donations that we received last
year from all of you.

The Persistent Storage hasn't changed much since we released it first in 2012
because the current code is hard to modify and improve. But, we learned from a
survey with users, that it could do a lot more for you if it had more features.
It could also be much easier to use for newcomers.

We started working on a complete redesign and rewrite of the Persistent Storage
that will make it easier to persist more settings in the future.

You can see how the new Persistent Storage will look like from the [mockups in our
blueprint](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/Persistent-Storage-redesign).

For this work, like for all major features in Tails, we practiced user-centered
design and tested our prototype with users to make sure that our prototype was
as easy to use as possible. You can read more about our design methodology in
our [interview with Simply Secure about formative
testing](https://simplysecure.org/blog/formative-testing).

Get more out of your Tails
==========================

- When doing automatic upgrades, the size of the download increases over time.

  You can [reduce the size of the download](https://tails.boum.org/doc/upgrade#reduce) of future
  automatic upgrades by doing a manual upgrade to the latest version.

- Our [new warnings page](https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warnings/) is
  shorter, easier to understand by less technical people, less scary, more
  helpful, and visually attractive. We also integrated it into our download
  page so that you can learn more about Tails while waiting for your download.

- With the major update of *OnionShare* included in Tails 4.20, you can now
  [host your own onion website](https://docs.onionshare.org/2.3.2/en/features.html#host-a-website)
  directly from Tails.

<img src="https://tails.boum.org/news/version_4.20/onionshare.png" alt=""/>

- You can start Tails from an [external hard disk](https://tails.boum.org/doc/advanced_topics/external_hard_disk)
  if you need more space or more speed for your Persistent Storage. To do so,
  remove the `live-media=removable` boot options when starting Tails.

[Sean Vegezzi](http://www.seanvegezzi.com/), an artist from New York, uses
Tails to investigates abuses of state power. He told our team:

> When I'm thinking about researching anything to do with the abuse of
> state power, the first thing that comes to mind is that we are living in an
> epoch where even visiting a URL could be used against you as circumstantial
> evidence in a court case stemming from a journalism / research / art
> project. Autonomy is a vague concept at best, but Tails offers me the
> closest thing to autonomy when doing sensitive research.

Sean used Tails to investigate, together with Laura Poitras, obscured nodes of
New York City's violent carceral and policing infrastructure, like this
[191-meter prison ship](https://twitter.com/ava/status/1398318458383728642) in
the South Bronx where 600 people are being held in terrifying conditions.

Laura and Sean, together with Forensics Architecture, are exposing more of
their investigations on the abuse of state power in their Berlin expo
[Circles](https://www.nbk.org/en/ausstellungen/aktuell.html).

Please get in touch with us if you have other exciting stories about your use
of Tails!
