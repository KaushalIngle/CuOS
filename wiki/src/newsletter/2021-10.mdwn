**Thank you so much for donating to Tails in the past!**

Donations from passionate people like you are our most valuable
source of funding because they guarantee our independence.

At Tails, we build liberating technology to put people in control of
their digital lives because the most vulnerable and oppressed people are
the most in need of privacy and security.

**Tails: their strongest protection.**

Many people who need Tails don't donate because they could get in trouble for
supporting a tool like Tails or simply because they don't have the money.

So when you donate to Tails, you are also offering this very precious
tool to the many others who need it.

That's why, if you have not set up a recurring donation to Tails yet,
we are kindly asking you to
[renew your donation](https://tails.boum.org/donate?r=mtop).

Our achievements in 2021
========================

- The continued global pandemic forced many people and organizations to
  keep on communicating online. Secure, private, non-biased, and anonymous
  digital tools are more crucial than ever.

  January 2021 saw for the first time **more than a million Tails boots**
  in a single month. We deduce how many times Tails boots from the
  number of checks for
  automatic upgrades.

- Connecting to Tor from Tails was problematic for our most vulnerable users
  and people who use Tails to circumvent nationwide censorship, especially in
  Asia.

  That's why we added a
  [*Tor Connection* assistant](https://tails.boum.org/news/version_4.20/)
  to **make it easier for them to connect to the Tor network** and enable
  **bridges** to hide their usage of Tor. Bridges use saw an increase of 465%
  compared with 2020.

- We entirely rewrote and redesigned our very old warnings page into a
  [shorter version](https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warnings/), easier to
  understand by less technical people, less scary, more helpful, and visually
  attractive.

- To shorten the time required for upgrades, we documented how a manual upgrade
  to the latest version can
  [**reduce the size** of future upgrades](https://tails.boum.org/doc/upgrade#reduce).

- We worked on a [**complete redesign and rewrite of the Persistent
  Storage**](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/Persistent-Storage-redesign)
  that will make it easier to persist more settings in the future. This work was
  funded entirely by the donations we received last year from all of you, and it
  will be the next big change in Tails.

- To always keep you as safe as possible, we have already released **12 new
  versions of Tails** in the last 10 months.

How we spend our money
======================

We are a very small non-profit and our yearly budget is ridiculously small
compared to the value of Tails.

We keep people safe more than 10 million times every year, for a budget under
$350 000.

- <span class="key-color purple-1"></span> **Releases, maintenance, and infrastructure (38%)**

  Tails is a neverending work of updates and maintenance: publishing a new
  release every 4 weeks to fix security vulnerabilities, adapting to new
  versions of the underlying software, keeping our website and
  development infrastructure secure and reliable, etc.

- <span class="key-color purple-2"></span> **New features and major improvements (26%)**

- <span class="key-color purple-3"></span> **User experience, documentation, and help desk (19%)**

  Even the most secure software is worthless if the people who need it
  cannot use it. We work hard to understand our users, make it easy to
  use Tails, and help them make informed security decisions.

- <span class="key-color gray"></span> **Administration and fundraising (17%)**

  We make the most of the money received because we prefer
  spending time improving Tails for our users.

Our impact
==========

2021 has been contrasted, with an unprecedented peak of more than one million
users in January, followed by a decrease that we attribute to issues
encountered during the upgrades and the end of mass lockdowns. Tails was used
by around 26 000 people every day in 2021.

This number had been steadily growing by 15% each year on average between 2012
and 2020.
