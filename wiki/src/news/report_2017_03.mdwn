Releases
========

[[Tails 2.11 was released on March 7|news/version_2.11]] (minor release).

Tails 2.12 is [[scheduled for April 18|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 2.11:

  - If running on a 32-bit processor, notify the user that it won't
    be able to start Tails 3.0 anymore. ([[!tails_ticket 12193]])

  - Notify I2P users that I2P will be removed in Tails
    2.12. ([[!tails_ticket 12271]])

  - Fix CVE-2017-6074 (local root privilege escalation) by disabling
    the `dccp` module. ([[!tails_ticket 12280]]) Also disable kernel
    modules for some other uncommon network protocols. (Part of
    [[!tails_ticket 6457]])

  - Tor Browser: Don't show offline warning when opening the local
    documentation of Tails. ([[!tails_ticket 12269]])

  - Fix rare issue causing automatic upgrades to not apply properly
   ([[!tails_ticket 8449]] and [[!tails_ticket 11839]])

  - Install Linux 4.8.15 to prevent GNOME from freezing with Intel
    GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics. ([[!tails_ticket 12217]])

## I2P to be removed

We are very sad to announce that Tails 2.11 will be the last version
to include [I2P](https://geti2p.net/), an alternative anonymizing
network. But we will be happy to reintroduce I2P if we find
a volunteer to take care of maintaining it in Tails. If you are
a developer and care about I2P in Tails, that person could be you!
Come [[talk to us|about/contact#tails-dev]]!

## Reproducible builds

We had a very productive 3-days sprint. After many iterations we have
finally seen an ISO image build reproducibly on several machines!
This implied fixing a number of things, and submitting a number of
patches upstream.

The build environment variations we've tested include: build system
clock (last month, next month; could not test next year yet), number
of CPU cores, CPU brand and model, building in Vagrant or not.

For details, see the
full report
that was written after the sprint.

## Porting Tails to Debian 9 (Stretch)

A bunch of Tails developers and technical writers had a very
productive sprint. The remaining work now feels tractable: aside of
the documentation update, only a few major regressions and adjustments
remain to be dealt with.

So, we are increasingly confident that we can make Tails 3.0 a solid
release, published according to schedule on June 13… but possibly
a little bit earlier or later, if it allows us to release at the same
time as Debian 9 (Stretch).

Two beta releases for Tails 3.0 were published
([[3.0~beta2|news/test_3.0-beta2]] on March 8,
[[3.0~beta3|news/test_3.0-beta3]] on March 19). They introduce the
following changes:

 * Upgrade Linux to 4.9.0-2 (version 4.9.13-1).

 * Make it possible to start graphical applications in the *Root Terminal*.

 * Improve styling of the *GNOME Shell* window list.

 * Tails Greeter:
   - Make the "Formats" settings in Tails Greeter take effect (it was
     introduced in Tails 3.0~alpha1 but has been broken since then).
   - Add keyboard shortcuts:
     * Alt key for accelerators in the main window
     * Ctrl+Shift+A for setting an administrator password
     * Ctrl+Shift+M for MAC spoofing settings
     * Ctrl+Shift+N for Tor network settings

 * Remove I2P.

 * Reintroduce the X11 guest utilities for VirtualBox (clipboard
   sharing and shared folders should work again).

 * Upgrade X.Org server and the modesetting driver in hope it will fix
   crashes when using some Intel graphics cards.

 * Automate the migration from KeePassX databases generated on
   Tails 2.x to the format required by KeePassX 2.0.x.

Infrastructure
==============

We upgraded some of our systems to Debian 9 (Stretch), in order to
help identify remaining issues before it becomes the new Debian
stable release.

All major browsers will now refuse to connect to our website, and to
any web service we host in the `tails.boum.org` namespace, unless
HTTPS is used with a valid certificate: they are now on the Google
Chrome 57 *HSTS preload* list, and all other major browsers build
their own list from this one.

We started researching our options for upgrading our server hardware.

We made some progress on deploying a web platform for translations
and an internal XMPP server.

We started a process to hire a new system administrator.

Funding
=======

We've sent a proposal to OTF, that covers:

 * adding TrueCrypt support in GNOME;
 * adding a graphical interface for the Additional Packages
   persistent feature;
 * a small fraction of our day-to-day operations budget.

Our budget until the end of March, 2018 was approved by the Tails
core contributors.

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

* On March 1st, Austin English presented [Tails at the Austin (Texas) Linux Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/linuxaustin/events/233035224/).
* Four of us attended the Tor developers meeting in Amsterdam. It was great!
  See the first report
  about it.
* Two of us gave a training about Tails and digital security at
  [Mediapart](https://www.mediapart.fr/). Apparently, everything went
  fine: attendees where mostly interested and happy with it, and asked
  a lot of questions, ranging from "How can I manage my passwords" to
  "How much does it cost to compromise my laptop?".

Upcoming events
---------------

* intrigeri will be giving a keynote at
  [CryptoRave](https://cryptorave.org/) (São Paulo, May 5-6).

On-going discussions
====================

We had a contributors meeting on March 3.
