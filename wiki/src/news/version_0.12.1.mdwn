Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 0.12.1, is out.

This is a [brown paper bag
release](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/brown-paper-bag-bug.html)
aimed at fixing two major problems introduced in Tails 0.12. While
upgrading is recommended, it's not strictly necessary for users that
haven't experienced any issues with Tails 0.12.

# Changes

* Iceweasel
  - Upgrade Torbutton to 1.4.6.
  - Upgrade AdBlock Plus to 2.1.
  - Update AdBlock patterns.

* Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux to 3.2.21-3 (linux-image-3.2.0-3-486).

* Software
  - Install python-pdfrw to re-add PDF support to the MAT.
  - Upgrade tails-greeter to 0.7.1, which fixes the race condition that
    broke administration password and locale settings on some systems.
