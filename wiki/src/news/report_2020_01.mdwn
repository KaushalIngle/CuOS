Releases
========

* [[Tails 4.2 was released on January 7|news/version_4.2]].

* [[Tails 4.2.2 was released on January 14|news/version_4.2.2]] (emergency release).

* Tails 4.3 is [[scheduled for February 11|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 4.2:

- Improvements to automatic upgrades

  We worked on important improvements to the automatic upgrade feature,
  which is still one of your major pain points when using Tails:

  - Until now, if your version of Tails was several months old, you
    sometimes had to do 2 or more automatic upgrades in a row.  For
    example, to upgrade from Tails 3.12 to Tails 3.16, you first had to
    upgrade to Tails 3.14.

    Starting with 4.2, direct automatic upgrades will be available from
    all prior versions to the latest version.

  - Until now, you could only do a limited number of automatic upgrades,
    after which you had to do a much more complicated [["manual"
    upgrade|doc/upgrade#manual]].

    Starting with 4.2, you will only have to do a manual upgrade between
    major versions, for example to upgrade to Tails 5.0 in 2021.

  - We made automatic upgrades use less memory.

  - We optimized a bit the size of the download when doing automatic
    upgrades.

- We included several command line tools used by
  [*SecureDrop*](https://securedrop.org/) users to analyze the metadata
  of leaked documents on computers that cannot use the *[[Additional
  Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]* feature:

  - [*PDF Redact Tools*](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/pdf-redact-tools)
    to redact and strip metadata from text documents before publishing
  - [*Tesseract OCR*](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
    to convert images containing text into a text document
  - [*FFmpeg*](https://ffmpeg.org/) to record and convert audio and video

- Open *~/Persistent/keepassx.kdbx* by default when starting *KeePassX*.
  If this database does not exist yet, stop pointing to it in the list
  of recent databases.

The following changes were introduced in Tails 4.2:

- Update *Tor Browser* to
  [9.0.4](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-904).

  This fixes a [[!mfsa 2020-03 desc="critical vulnerability"]]
  in the JavaScript JIT compiler of *Firefox* and *Tor Browser*.

  Mozilla is aware of targeted attacks in the wild abusing this
  vulnerability.

  This vulnerability only affects the *standard* [[security
  level|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#security-level]] of *Tor
  Browser*. The *safer* and *safest* security levels are not affected.

- Avoid a 2-minutes delay when restarting after doing an automatic
  upgrade. ([[!tails_ticket 17026]])

Code
====

- We fixed critical regressions that were introduced while improving
  automatic upgrades.

- We started work on making the download of automatic upgrades more robust
  ([[!tails_ticket 15875]]).

- We fixed the long delay while rebooting after applying an automatic upgrade
  ([[!tails_ticket 17026]]).

- In order to make the development process a bit smoother:
   - We now use the tarball with all Tor Browser langpacks ([[!tails_ticket
     17400]]), instead of downloading a complete Tor Browser for every language.
   - Our build system is now able to cache the website build.

Documentation and website
=========================

- Göktürk Yüksek improved the `dd` command in the expert installation scenario
  to display progress (`status=progress`) and sync on-the-fly (`oflag=direct`).

- We fixed the display of the output of `rsync` when doing a [[backup of the
  persistent volume|doc/first_steps/persistence/backup]].

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. A lot of users are complaining about [[!tails_ticket 17183 desc="Seahorse failing to import public keys"]]

1. A few people reported graphic issues, mostly [[!tails_ticket 16875]], but also [[!tails_ticket 17155 desc="with Nvidia Turing"]]

1. Some users are facing issues ([[!tails_ticket 17388]], [[!tails_ticket 17430]], [[!tails_ticket 17418]]) with some network adapter since 4.1.1

Infrastructure
==============

- We made progress on our migration to GitLab.

- We resumed work on upgrading our CI hardware ([[!tails_ticket 16960]]).

Funding
=======

- We added ThinkPenguin as a sponsor.

- We teared down the donation campaign. We raised around 100k€ from
  2&#8239;000 donations.

- We were invited to submit a full proposal for the joint grant proposal with
  Tor and the Guardian Project to the DRL Internet Freedom program.
