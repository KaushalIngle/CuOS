[[!tag announce]]

Tails 4.11, scheduled for September 22, will be the first version of
Tails to include Tor Browser 10.0 and to support persistent settings
on the Welcome Screen!

You can help Tails by testing the release candidate for Tails 4.11 now.

[[!toc levels=1]]

# Persistent settings on the Welcome Screen

If you enable this persistence feature your Welcome Screen settings,
like language selection and any administration password, will be
automatically saved between sessions. While at the Welcome Screen the
settings are restored as soon as you unlock your persistent encrypted
volume. Please let us know if there are any problems!

# Tor Browser 10.0 (alpha 6)

This new major release of Tor Browser is based on a brand new Firefox
ESR series, version 78, which contains tons of changes, most under the
hood. There's a risk that some of these changes break some expected
feature in Tails, so please pay close attention and report any such
issues to us!

# Changelog

For more details about what has changed in Tails 4.11~rc1, read our
[changelog](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/raw/4.11-rc1/debian/changelog).

# Known issues

* In Tor Browser, opening `file://` URLs has a problem: opening any
  such local file will result in an infinite refresh loop like if you
  kept the F5 key pressed, so it will likely not display anything. At
  the moment this makes it impossible to read the offline
  documentation inside Tails, for instance. This will be fixed in
  Tails 4.11.

See the list of [[long-standing issues|support/known_issues]].

# How to test Tails 4.11~rc1?

Keep in mind that this is a test image. We tested that it is not broken in
obvious ways, but it might still contain undiscovered issues.

Please, report any new problem to <tails-testers@boum.org> (public mailing list).
