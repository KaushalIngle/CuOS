# For users of a persistent Electrum Bitcoin client

If you have enabled the <span class="guilabel">Bitcoin client</span>
(<span class="application">Electrum</span>) persistence feature and
have *upgraded* a Tails USB stick installation to Tails 1.8.1, then
please follow these steps in order to make Electrum able to connect
to the network:

1. Make sure <span class="application">Electrum</span> is not running.

1. Choose <span class="menuchoice"><span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">Accessories</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Terminal</span></span> to open a terminal.
