# Usability improvements

## Installation pages

We fixed all the low-hanging fruits among the issues identified in December
during [[usability tests of first-time use|news/report_2021_12]]:

  * [[!tails_ticket 18764]]: "Start in macOS" is confusing when obvious
  * [[!tails_ticket 18765]]: QR code in steps is unclear
  * [[!tails_ticket 18771]]: Add screenshot of Plymouth to installation steps
  * [[!tails_ticket 18773]]: Update time estimates in overview

After which we started a bigger project to restructure our installation pages.
Stay tuned!

## Connecting to Tor

Polishing the user experience of connecting to Tor from Tails is one of our top
priorities for 2021-2023. We are continuously designing and implementing
improvements in this area. Here's the January 2021 edition :)

We noticed a while ago, thanks to usability tests, that users not accustomed to
the GNOME desktop have difficulties connecting to Wi-Fi. So we made this more
discoverable last year, by making Wi-Fi settings reachable from *Tor
Connection*. Unfortunately, while our initial implementation looked OK in
a simplified test environment, it turns out it was not working in real user
scenarios, so we fixed it ([[!tails_ticket 18587]]).

Metrics
=======

Tails has been started more than 773 496 times this month. This makes 24 951 boots a day on average.
