We are happy to announce the launch of our [translation
platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/).

Tails is an out-of-the-box tool that aims at helping people to preserve
their privacy and anonymity online. It comes with a [website &
documentation](https://tails.boum.org) that is currently translated into
6 languages besides English: Farsi, French, German, Italian, Portuguese
and Spanish. To help more users at risk around the world to understand
and use Tails, updating and translating the documentation into more
languages is welcome and needed.

This is why we have put enormous effort into setting up an easier way to
translate the documentation: welcome our new [translation
platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/). After [creating an
account](https://translate.tails.boum.org/accounts/register/)
you can start suggesting translations right away! For more details on
how to get started, make sure to read our [[documentation for
translators|/contribute/how/translate/with_translation_platform/]].

We are specifically looking for translations to a set of
[[languages|/contribute/how/translate/#tier-1-languages]] that we
consider valuable to our user base: Arabic, Farsi, French, German,
Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese,
Spanish, and Turkish.

Please refer to the section [[Getting
help|/contribute/how/translate/with_translation_platform#getting-help]]
if you have further questions or experience technical problems.

Thank you for your contribution!
