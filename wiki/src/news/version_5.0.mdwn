We are especially proud to present you Tails 5.0, the first version of
Tails based on Debian 11 (Bullseye). It brings new versions of a lot of
the software included in Tails and new OpenPGP tools.

<h1 id="features">New features</h1>

## Kleopatra

We added [[*Kleopatra*|doc/encryption_and_privacy/kleopatra]] to replace the
*OpenPGP Applet* and the *Password and Keys* utility, also known as *Seahorse*.

The *OpenPGP Applet* was not actively developped anymore and was complicated
for us to keep in Tails. The *Password and Keys* utility was also poorly
maintained and Tails users suffered from too many of its issues until now, like
[[!tails_ticket 17183]]. 

*Kleopatra* provides equivalent features in a single tool and is more
actively developed.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- The Additional Software feature of the Persistent Storage is enabled by
  default to make it faster and more robust to configure your first additional
  software package.

- You can now use the Activities overview to access your windows and
  applications. To access the Activities overview, you can either:

  - Click on the <b>Activities</b> button.
  - Throw your mouse pointer to the top-left hot corner.
  - Press the <b>Super</b> ([[!img lib/start.png alt="" class="symbolic" link="no"]]) key on your keyboard.

  You can see your windows and applications in the overview. You can also start
  typing to search your applications, files, and folders.

## Included software

Most included software has been upgraded in Debian 11, for example:

- Update *Tor Browser* to [11.0.11](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-11011).

- Update *GNOME* from 3.30 to 3.38, with lots of small improvements to the
  desktop, the core *GNOME* utilities, and the locking screen.

- Update *MAT* from 0.8 to 0.12, which adds support to clean metadata from SVG,
  WAV, EPUB, PPM, and Microsoft Office files.

- Update *Audacity* from 2.2.2 to 2.4.2.

- Update *Disk Utility* from 3.30 to 3.38.

- Update *Inkscape* from 0.92 to 1.0.

- Update *LibreOffice* from 6.1 to 7.0.

## Hardware support

- The new support for driverless printing and scanning in Linux makes it easier
  to make recent printers and scanners work in Tails.

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

- Fix unlocking *VeraCrypt* volumes that have very long passphrases.
  ([[!tails_ticket 17474]])

<h1 id="issues">Known issues</h1>

<!--

Copy the known issues from the previous version if they haven't been
solved or move them to /support/known_issues if more appropriate.

-->

- *Additional Software* sometimes doesn't work when restarting for the first
  time right after creating a Persistent Storage. ([[!tails_ticket 18839]])

  To solve this, install the same additional software package again after
  restarting with the Persistent Storage for the first time.

- *Thunderbird* displays a popup to choose an application when opening links.
  ([[!tails_ticket 18913]])

- *Tails Installer* sometimes fails to clone. ([[!tails_ticket 18844]])
