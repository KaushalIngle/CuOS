[[!meta title="Tails report for November, 2012"]]

November was pretty intense a month for Tails, including two major
releases. It was not the happiest though, due to personal issues,
unresolved conflicts within the team and server hard disks dying.

Anyhow, Tails' life does go on. Here is a report of what happened
last month.

[[!toc levels=1]]

Releases
========

Tails 0.14 was [[released on November 13th|news/version_0.14]] and
0.15 was [[released on November 28th|news/version_0.15]]. From now on,
we should be in a position to stick to the [[6-weeks release
cycle|contribute/release_schedule]] we have been aiming at for a while.

The Tails 0.16 release is scheduled for the first half of January.

People
======

Tails has been started and successfully connected to the Tor network
around 83731 times in November. That makes a boot every 31 seconds on
average. This number is an approximation from the requests made for the
security announcements feed. The later is retrieved by Tails after being
connected to Tor to eventually encourage users to update.

41 reports were received through WhisperBack.

The forum activity is still very high:
903 messages, 151 signed by Tails.
