# Known issues

After upgrading to Tails 3.8, you have to go through the
<span class="application">Enigmail Setup Wizard</span> again every time you
restart Tails.

Your OpenPGP keys and your per-recipient rules are preserved.

To avoid going through the <span class="application">Enigmail Setup
Wizard</span>, you can execute the following command in a terminal
before starting <span class="application">Thunderbird</span>:

<pre>echo 'pref("extensions.enigmail.configuredVersion", "2.0.7");' >> ~/.thunderbird/profile.default/preferences/0000tails.js</pre>
