In August, we celebrated the [10 years
birthday](https://twitter.com/torproject/status/1162386781515460614)
of the first public announcement of _amnesia_, the project which would
eventually give birth to Tails after the merger with Incognito üéÇ :)

This led Edward Snowden to write [this
testimonial](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1165297667490103302):
<em>‚ÄúIn 2013, when a small team of journalists and I went head to head
against @NSAGov to reveal the secret system of global mass
surveillance, we used @Tails_Live to communicate‚Äîto reduce the risk
of basic but deadly mistakes.<br/>
The NSA only learned of our plan when it hit the news.‚Äù</em>

Releases
========

* [[Tails 4.0~beta1 was released on August 7|news/test_4.0-beta1]].
  This is the first beta for the upcoming version of Tails based on
  Debian 10 (Buster).

  Many thanks to everyone who tried it and gave us feedback!

* Tails 3.16 and 4.0~beta2 are [[scheduled for September 3|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

- Preparations for Tails 4.0, based on Debian 10 "Buster"

   - Decreased by 200-300 MiB the amount of memory used by Tails
     ([[!tails_ticket 12092]]).
   - Fixed a regression that made the login process slower than in
     Tails¬†3.x ([[!tails_ticket 16805]]).

- Test suite improvements

   - We fixed a number of issues that lead our test suite to report
     false positives ([[!tails_ticket 11592]], [[!tails_ticket
     17004]], [[!tails_ticket 15321]]).
   - Use a more recent Dogtail, run it with Python 3, and take benefit
     from the new UTF-8 support ([[!tails_ticket 16976]]).

- New automated tests

   - Installing Tails from a USB image with GNOME Disks ([[!tails_ticket 16004]])
   - VeraCrypt PIM feature ([[!tails_ticket 15946]])

- We made good progress on persisting a seed for the [[!wikipedia
  Pseudorandom number generator]] across boots ([[!tails_ticket
  11897]]). There's now a good chance that this work is included
  in a Tails release by the end of the year.

- We completed the first iteration of our effort to [[!tails_ticket
  7036 desc="move the source code for our custom software to our main
  Git repository"]]: the Greeter [[!tails_ticket 16912 desc="was
  migrated"]]. This will avoid quite some busywork, make it easier to
  contribute to the affected code bases, and increase the value of our
  reproducible builds, by removing some binary blobs from our set of
  _de facto_ trusted inputs.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We finished updating all of our documentation to Tails based on Debian
  10 (Buster). ([[!tails_ticket 16282]])

- We improved the troubleshooting section when Tails doesn't start on
  Mac. ([[!tails_ticket 15127]])

User experience
===============

- We reworked in depth our
  plans to improve the user
  experience of the network connection (configuration and startup).

Infrastructure
==============

- We upgraded to Gitolite v3.

- We fixed a number of bugs in our [web translation
  platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/), thanks to feedback
  from early adopters. It should soon be officially ready for
  production usage.

- We spent lots of time fighting a [[!wikipedia
  Denial-of-service_attack desc="DDoS"]] against our Redmine. Not our
  idea of fun :(

- We scheduled the upgrade of our Jenkins ([[!tails_ticket 10068]]).

Funding
=======

- We're working on a joint grant proposal with Tor and the
  Guardian Project.

Outreach

Press and testimonials
======================

* 2019-08-04: In [Attorney for Daniel Hale blasts indictment for leaking
  classified drone documents](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/daniel-hale-indictment/),
  David Gilmour from The Daily Dot explains that the indictment of Daniel Hale
  for the leaks of the [Drone Papers](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/)
  focuses his use of anonymity tools like Tails and Tor. According to Hale's
  attorneys Jesselyn Radack <em>‚ÄúThese cases are criminalizing both
  whistleblowing and journalistic best practices like using encryption and
  protecting source anonymity‚Äù</em>.
