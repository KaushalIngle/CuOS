# Changes

## Upgrades and changes

  - Upgrade *Tor Browser* to version 5.0.3 (based on
    Firefox 38.3.0 ESR).
  - Upgrade *I2P* to version 0.9.22 and enable its AppArmor profile.

There are numerous other changes that might not be apparent in the daily
operation of a typical user. Technical details of all the changes
are listed in the Changelog.

## Fixed problems

  - Fix several issues related to *MAC address spoofing*:
    * If MAC address spoofing fails on a network interface and
      this interface cannot be disabled, then all networking is now
      completely disabled.
    * A notification is displayed if MAC address spoofing causes network
      issues, for example if a network only allows connections from a
      list of authorized MAC addresses.
