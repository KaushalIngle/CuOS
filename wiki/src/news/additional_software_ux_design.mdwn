We are working on making it much easier to **permanently install
additional software in Tails**.

We want to test our design with users to make sure that it is really
easy to use.

Don't be shy! It will be a great opportunity to contribute to world-class
privacy software like Tails, even if you don't feel really tech-savvy.

The tests will take place in Berlin (Wedding) in January on:

- Saturday 27
- Sunday 28
- Monday 29

Plan to stay with us for 1 hour.

We will give you a Tails T-shirt as a token of our thanks.

Please, take this survey so we can organize our schedule:

And if you can't come, maybe you can share this with 2-3 other people in
Berlin?
