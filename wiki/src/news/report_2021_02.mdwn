Releases
========

[[Tails 4.16 was released on February 22|news/version_4.16]].

Tails 4.17 is [[scheduled for March 23|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====
 - We started the redesign [[network connection
   configuration|https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/network_connection#ux-design]]:
    - Usability testing of paper prototypes for the network connection
      configuration.
    - Display Tor Launcher to all users by default ([[!tails_ticket 17330]]).
    - Write a replacement of Tor Launcher ([[!tails_ticket 17215]]).
- We are rewriting the Persistent Storage settings in Python ([[!tails_ticket 17803]]).
- We improved Help Desk standard replies ([[!tails_ticket 18070]]).

Documentation and website
=========================
- Started a sprint to rewrite our warnings page ([[!tails_ticket 8845]]). We'll strip it down to 3 main warnings:
    - Untrusted computers
    - Limitations of Tor
    - Identity management

  And embed them directly on the download page. ([[!tails_ticket 9386]]).
- Documented that [[Tails does not work with Apple M1 chip|/doc/about/requirements/]] ([[!tails_ticket 18066]]).
- Documented [[how to start Tails from an external hard disk|/doc/about/requirements/]] ([[!tails_ticket 18113]]).
- Explained what "[[Your browser is being managed by your organization|/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/#security-level]]" means ([[!tails_ticket 18029]]).
- Avoid pointing people to [[empty security advisories from our release
  notes|https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/stable/config/release_management/templates/security_advisory.mdwn]]
  ([[!tails_ticket 18221]]).
- Documented better [[what to do when the Persistent Storage
  disappears|/support/known_issues/#persistence-disappears]]
  ([[!tails_ticket 17116]]).

User experience
===============

Big redesigns
-------------

- We did a design sprint and usability tests in January to [[redesign
  the Persistent Storage|https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/Persistent-Storage-redesign]].
- Started a [[!tails_ticket 5501 desc="discussion on how we should save
  language and keyboard layout from the Welcome Screen"]].
- Did another design sprint and usability tests on the [[process of connecting
  to Tor from Tails|https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/blueprints/-/wikis/network_connection#ux-design]].

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

- Users reported problems with [[!tails_ticket 18184 desc="automatic upgrades,
  caused by a change on the CA"]].
- Still some users write to us about problems importing GPG keys with
  Seahorse.
- We also got the usual '[[javascript is enabled|/support/faq/#javascript]]'
  emails. We kindly ask for platforms or websites that include Tails on their
  workflow to update their documentation.

Funding
=======

We have finished analyzing [[last year's donation campaign
results|/news/donations_2020/]], thanks to everybody that contributed to the
development of Tails.

If you missed the end of the year donation campaign, do not worry, you can
[[still donate to sustain our work|donate]]!

On-going discussions
