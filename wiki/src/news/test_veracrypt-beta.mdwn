You can help Tails! The beta version for the VeraCrypt support in Tails is ready for testing.
We are very excited.

[[!toc levels=1]]

# What's new in the Beta?

We worked to integrate VeraCrypt support into the existing GNOME workflow
for unlocking encrypted volumes. As a result, most of the features already
provided for LUKS volumes are now also provided for VeraCrypt volumes.
This includes unlocking volumes via the <span class=\"application\">GNOME Disks</span>
application and integration into the places sidebar in
<span class=\"application\">GNOME Files</span>. If your file
containers have the ".hc" file extension, they will be recognized as
VeraCrypt volumes and can be easily unlocked in <span class=\"application\">GNOME Files</span>.

Additionally, we created a small application, <span class=\"application\">
VeraCrypt Mounter</span>, which makes it easier to unlock VeraCrypt volumes,
especially file containers that do not have the ".hc" extension.

# How to test the Beta?

Download and install the ISO image on a USB stick or DVD, start it and
try to unlock your existing VeraCrypt volumes.

We are interested in your feedback on bugs and usability of this feature.

- Are there any steps that are not clear?
- Did you run into technical issues?

Please send feedback emails to tails-testers@boum.org.
