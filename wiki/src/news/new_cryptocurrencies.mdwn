Users of cryptocurrencies have been huge supporters of Tails in all our
previous donation campaigns and we are extremely thankful to them!

As part of our on-going [[donation|news/2018-fundraiser]]
[[campaign|achievements_in_2018]], we are now accepting donations in 4
new cryptocurrencies, in addition to Bitcoins.

We chose these 4 because they are the most popular and easiest for us to
receive. We might add more cryptocurrencies in the future as they gain
momentum.

But as of now, we hope the 5 crypto and 4 legacy currencies you'll find on the
donation page will provide you with the necessary means to support us!
