# Critical security vulnerabilities in *Tor Browser*

<a id="arbitrary-code-execution"></a>

## Fixed arbitrary code execution

**This vulnerability is fixed in Tails 3.14.1.**

A [critical vulnerability](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-18/)
was discovered in the JavaScript engine of *Firefox* and *Tor Browser*.
This vulnerability allowed a malicious website to execute arbitrary
code, which means possibly taking over your browser and turning it into
a malicious application.

This vulnerability has already been used to
[target employees of the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-zero-day-was-used-in-attack-against-coinbase-employees-not-its-users/).

People using the *Safer* or *Safest* [[security level of *Tor
Browser*|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#security-level]] are not
affected because the feature of JavaScript that is affected (the
*[[!wikipedia just-in-time compilation]]*) is disabled in these security
levels.

Because *Tor Browser* in Tails is [[confined using
*AppArmor*|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#confinement]], the impact
of this vulnerability in Tails is less than in other operating systems.
For example, an exploited *Tor Browser* in Tails could have accessed
your files in the *Tor Browser* and *Persistent/Tor Browser* folders but
not anywhere else.

# Known issues

## Tails fails to start a second time on some computers ([[!tails_ticket 16389]])

On some computers, after installing Tails to a USB stick,
Tails starts a first time but fails to start a second time. In some
cases, only BIOS (Legacy) was affected and the USB stick was not listed
in the Boot Menu.

We partially fix this issue in 3.14.1 but are still investigating it, so if it happens to you, please
report your findings by email to <tails-testers@boum.org>. Mention the
model of the computer and the USB stick. This mailing
list is [archived publicly](https://lists.autistici.org/list/tails-testers.html).

To fix this issue:

1. Reinstall your USB stick using the same installation method.

1. Start Tails for the first time and [[set up an administration
   password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Root Terminal</span>
   </span> to open a <span class="application">Root Terminal</span>.

1. Execute the following command:

   <p class="pre command">sgdisk --recompute-chs /dev/bilibop</p>

You can also test an experimental image:

1. [Download the *.img* file from our development
   server](https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_bugfix-16389-recompute-chs/lastSuccessful/archive/build-artifacts/).

1. Install it using the same installation methods.

   We don't provide any OpenPGP signature or other verification technique
   for this test image. Please only use it for testing.

See the list of [[long-standing issues|support/known_issues]].
