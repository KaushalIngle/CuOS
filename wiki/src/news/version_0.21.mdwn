[[numerous security issues|security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.20.1]].

# Changes

Notable user-visible changes include:

* Security fixes
  - Don't grant access to the Tor control port for the desktop user.
    Else, an attacker able to run arbitrary code as this user could
    obtain the public IP.
  - Don't allow the desktop user to directly change persistence
    settings. Else, an attacker able to run arbitrary code as this
    user could leverage this feature to gain persistent root access,
    as long as persistence is enabled.
  - Install Iceweasel 17.0.10esr with Torbrowser patches.
  - Patch Torbutton to make window resizing closer to what the
    design says.

* New features
  - Add a persistence preset for printing settings.
  - Support running Tails off more types of SD cards.

* Minor improvements
  - Add a KeePassX launcher to the top panel.
  - Improve the bug reporting workflow.
  - Prefer stronger ciphers when encrypting data with GnuPG.
  - Exclude the version string in GnuPG's ASCII armored output.
  - Use the same custom Startpage search URL than the TBB.
    This apparently disables the new broken "family" filter.
  - Provide a consistent path to the persistent volume mountpoint.

* Localization
  - Many translation updates all over the place.

Changelog
for technical details.
