Every day, Tails helps thousands of people to safely use
their computers online and offline.

Tails is available for free because we believe that nobody should have
to pay to be protected from surveillance and censorship.

Tails is free software because if our source code was closed, there
would be no way of verifying that it is secure.

In today's Internet, the most rewarded economical strategy is to rely on
advertisement and tracking. But one of our reasons
to exist is also to protect you against targeted advertisement,
and we obviously don't want to rely on these sources of revenue.

The number of people using Tails is constantly growing and so is our responsibility to
provide the easiest and safest tool possible. In 2019, we want Tails to be smoother to
install, upgrade, use and to include even more security protection.

Making Tails costs us around 200&#8239;000€ each year. This is a really
small number given all the work done, and many of us still do a lot of
work for free in addition to paid hours.

Our money comes from:

- Passionate people like you
- Private companies like Mozilla, DuckDuckGo, or Lush
- Foundations and NGOs like The Handshake Foundation or The ISC Project
- Funds from the US government like the Open Technology Fund

We often hear complaints about software projects
that are meant to fight surveillance, like Tor and Tails, getting funds
from the US government. We
share this concern and we will never be at ease
as long as the well-being of our
project depends on such funding.

This is why it's so <b>important to be sustained
by users like you, and our independence protected by your donations.</b>

we know that Tails is used more than 20&#8239;000 times every
day. <b>If each user gave $6, our
fundraiser would be done in one day.</b> The price of a USB stick is all we need.

But we know that many of [[the people who need Tails the
most|news/who_are_you_helping]] can't donate, because they would get in
trouble for giving to an anti-surveillance tool like Tails, or simply
because they don't have the money.

Last year we received 1&#8239;167
donations for a total of 101&#8239;644€. <b>This year, we aim for 120&#8239;000€
and a larger number of donors.</b>

Please consider taking a minute to donate to Tails today.
