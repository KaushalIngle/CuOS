Releases
========

* [[Tails 2.10 was released on January 24th|news/version_2.10]] (minor release).

* Tails 2.11 is [[scheduled for March 7th|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 2.10:

  - We installed [[*OnionShare*|doc/anonymous_internet/onionshare]],
    a tool for anonymous file sharing.

    [[!img news/version_2.10/onionshare.png link="no"]]

  - We enabled the
    [[circuit view|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#circuit-view]]
    in *Tor Browser*.

  - Replace *AdBlock Plus* with *uBlock Origin*.

  - Configure the *APT* package manage to use Debian's Onion services.

  - Install the *AMDGPU* display driver. This should improve the
    support for newer AMD graphics adapters.

  - Renamed the *Boot Loader Menu* entries from "Live" to "Tails", and
    replaced the confusing "failsafe" wording with "Troubleshooting
    Mode".

  - Add support for [[!wikipedia exFAT]].

  - Remove *Nyx* (previously called *arm*).

  - Rewrite *Tor control port filter* entirely. Now Tails can safely
    support *OnionShare*, the circuit view of *Tor Browser*, and
    similar. This also enabled Whonix to replace their own similar
    piece of software with this one.

Code
====

* We (almost) finished updating the AppArmor policy in Debian Stretch
  so that it supports merged-/usr systems.
* We started evaluating
  [USBGuard](https://dkopecek.github.io/usbguard/), and
  [posted](https://github.com/dkopecek/usbguard/issues/157)
  suggestions to improve its user experience, that
  upstream warmly welcomes.

Documentation and website
=========================

* We documented how to use [[*OnionShare*|doc/anonymous_internet/onionshare]],
  a tool for anonymous file sharing.

* We documented the [[circuit view|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#circuit-view]]
  in *Tor Browser*.

User experience
===============

* We've been working on improving the user experience of Tails Installer
* For the Tails 3.0 test images, in Tails Greeter we will drop the read-only persistence option. We don't know yet if we will be able to re-add this option to Tails 3.0 once we release it, but we are working on it.

Infrastructure
==============

* We started to set up a XMPP server to satisfy the need for private
  communication tools expressed by one of our teams.
* We enabled an Onion service for our APT repository
  ([[!tails_ticket 11556]]).
* We improved our systems so that they send less useless email to our
  system administrators.
* We started updating our Puppet modules to better support Debian Stretch.

Funding
=======

* [LinuxFr: Tails, nous avons besoin de vos dons](https://linuxfr.org/news/tails-nous-avons-besoin-de-vos-dons) was published as a follow-up on our call for donations.
* We received feedback from OTF about our concept note, and started
  working on our answer.

Outreach
========

Upcoming events
---------------

* We have a booth at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2017/) in Brussels.
* Tails will be presented at a [cryptoparty](http://biblio.insa-rennes.fr/crypto) on March 4th 2017 in Rennes, France.
* We started organizing a Debian event that will take place in Paris
  on May 13-14. Stay tuned!

On-going discussions
====================

* We've been discussing how to improve our memory erasure process.
* We've announced that [[Tails 3.0 will require a 64-bit processor|news/Tails_3.0_will_require_a_64-bit_processor]].
