Code
====

- We started evaluating our options regarding a possible
  [[!tails_ticket 14789 desc="upgrade to Linux 4.13"]]
  in Tails 3.3.

- We had a first sprint to evaluate how it would be like if Tails was
  based on quarterly snapshots of Debian testing:
  - We ported most of Tails to Debian Buster.
  - We adjusted most of our test suite accordingly.
  - We designed a [[!tails_ticket 14791 desc="process"]] and
    implemented [[!tails_ticket 14579 desc="tools"]] that will allow
    us to tell technical writers what part of the documentation is
    affected by changes in our code, test suite, or installed packages.
  - We adapted the Debian Security Tracker code to
    [[!tails_ticket 14823 desc="track security issues fixed in Debian but not in the snapshots Tails uses"]].
  - In November we will check how we are doing and will decide what
    the next steps shall be.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We improved our donation page in preparation of the donation campaign
  to mention CCT instead of Zwiebelfreunde and be better structured.

User experience
===============

- We installed [*LimeSurvey* on our infrastructure](https://survey.tails.boum.org)
  and advertised a first survey on file storage encryption from the homepage of
  *Tor Browser* in Tails. Our users have been very responsive to our
  call
  and since then we have gathered 30 complete answers to the survey each
  day on average, reaching 375 in total on October 30.

- We extensively tested older and newer versions of UUI to understand why
  [[!tails_ticket 13206 desc="cloning from a USB stick installed using UUI
  sometimes fails"]]. Everything is fine as long as "*Format in FAT32*" is
  checked which is documented but not always applied by users, so we should
  either improve UUI, our documentation, or *Tails Greeter* to prevent that.

- We continued to port our verification extension for Firefox to Web
  Extensions and we now have a working prototype
  that computes the checksum in a reasonable time (45 seconds)!

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. [Tails Installer treats drives differently depending on when they are plugged](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/14755)

1. [Install by cloning sometimes silently fails from a stick installed with UUI](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/13206)

1. A few users with Nvidia graphics reported some issues.

Infrastructure
==============

- We consolidated our system administration team by hiring a new
  member. Welcome, groente!

- For our installation of *LimeSurvey*, we implemented an automatic monitoring
  of new upstream versions to notify system administrators when a security
  update is available (Git repository).

Funding
=======

- The proposal that we submitted to the [Lush Digital Fund](https://uk.lush.com/article/introducing-digital-fund)
  in May was accepted. It will fund the integration of a web-based translation
  platform in the build of our website and documentation.

- We published our [[finances for 2016|doc/about/finances#2016]].

- We launched our 2017 donation campaign and blogged about [[Many hands make
  Tails|news/many_hands_make_tails]].
