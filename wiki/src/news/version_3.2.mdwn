# Changes

## New features

- We added support for PPPoE and dial-up Internet connections.

  Please [tell us](mailto:tails-testers@boum.org) if this still doesn't work
  for you!

- We installed [*BookletImposer*](http://kjo.herbesfolles.org/bookletimposer/)
  to convert linear PDF documents into booklets, and vice-versa.

  [[!img bookletimposer.png link="no"]]

- We added *GNOME Screen Keyboard* to replace *Florence*, the previous virtual
  keyboard, which had [many issues](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&set_filter=1&f%5B%5D=cf_18&op%5Bcf_18%5D=%3D&v%5Bcf_18%5D%5B%5D=On-screen+keyboard&f%5B%5D=subject&op%5Bsubject%5D=%7E&v%5Bsubject%5D%5B%5D=Florence&f%5B%5D=fixed_version_id&op%5Bfixed_version_id%5D=%3D&v%5Bfixed_version_id%5D%5B%5D=294&f%5B%5D=&c%5B%5D=status&c%5B%5D=priority&c%5B%5D=fixed_version&c%5B%5D=subject&c%5B%5D=category&c%5B%5D=cf_15&c%5B%5D=assigned_to&c%5B%5D=cf_9&group_by=&t%5B%5D=).

## Upgrades and changes

- Upgrade *Linux* to 4.12.12. This should improve the support for newer
  hardware, especially Nvidia Maxwell graphics card.

- Upgrade *Thunderbird* from 45.8 to 52.3.

### User experience

- Require a 8 GB USB stick to install Tails. 4 GB USB sticks that are already
  installed can still be upgraded.

- *Tails Installer* now detects when the target USB stick has Tails
  installed already and automatically proposes to upgrade.
  This made possible to remove the initial splash screen.

### Security

- Disable *Bluetooth* to protect against the [*BlueBorne*
  attack](https://www.armis.com/blueborne/). [[!tails_ticket 14655]]

  Please [let us know](mailto:tails-testers@boum.org) if this makes it hard for
  you to use Tails!

- Increase the randomization of <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia
  Address_space_layout_randomization desc="ASLR"]]</span> to the maximum.
  [[!tails_ticket 11840]]

- Deny access to the D-Bus service of *Pidgin* to prevent other applications to
  access and modify its configuration. [[!tails_ticket 14612]].

## Fixed problems

- Fix the import of secret OpenPGP keys in *Password and Keys*.
  [[!tails_ticket 12733]]
