Releases
========

In September, we released [[4.22|news/version_4.22]] with updates for Tor
Browser and Thunderbird, improvements to the Tor Connection
Assistant, and several fixes.

Tails 4.23 is [[scheduled for October 5|contribute/calendar]].

Highlights of the month
=======================

 - We got several reports about folks being unable to download Tails images
   using Google Chrome, Chromium or Chromium-based browsers, and fixed
   it. ([[!tails_ticket 18616]])

 - We also received reports about a new problem with the Additional Software
   feature (`Splitting of clearsigned file` errors), and we're working on it! ([[!tails_ticket 18620]])

 - We improved our documentation on [[Connecting to the Tor
   network|doc/anonymous_internet/tor]] and added a new nice
   diagram.

   [[!img doc/anonymous_internet/tor/tor.svg link="no" alt="A Tor connection goes through 3 relays with the last one establishing the actual connection to the final destination"]]

 - The [[documentation style guide|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide]]
   is now the single place where we describe how we write our documentation.
