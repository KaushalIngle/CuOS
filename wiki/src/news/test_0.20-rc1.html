         href=""
      >Tails 0.20~rc1 ISO image</a>

<h1><a id="known_issues"></a>Known issues in 0.20~rc1</h1>

<ul>
<li>The ISO image and signature were mistakenly named with "~rc1" (notice the tilde) instead of "-rc1", like before.</li>
<li>The French translation is broken to the point that it prevents some applications from starting (like the emergency shutdown applet).</li>
</ul>

<p>All these issues are fixed in Git and will be fixed in Tails 0.20.</p>
