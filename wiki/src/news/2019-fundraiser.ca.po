"The [2019 World Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/2019-world-press-"
"freedom-index-cycle-fear) compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) shows "
"how hatred of journalists has degenerated into violence, contributing to an "
"increase in fear. The number of countries regarded as safe, where "
"journalists can work in complete security, continues to decline, while "
"authoritarian regimes continue to tighten their grip on the media."

"According to the [2019 Report by United Nations' Special Rapporteur David "
"Kaye](https://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/HRC/41/35&Lang=E), "
"surveillance of individuals – often journalists, activists, opposition "
"figures, critics and others exercising their right to freedom of expression "
"– thrives because of weak controls on exports and transfers of surveillance "
"technology to repressive governments. This surveillance is known to lead to "
"arbitrary detention, sometimes to torture and possibly to extrajudicial "
"killings."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"These technologies include targeted malware, online interception of network "
"communications, and deep packet inspection; all technologies that Tails is "
"one of the best tool to protect from while reducing the risk of dangerous "
"mistakes."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"A legal framework to regulate this surveillance industry, as recommended by "
"David Kaye, might be useful for the future. But digital freedom tools like "
"Tails are more needed than ever right now, in an act of empowerment and self-"
"defense."
