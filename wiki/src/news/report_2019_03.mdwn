Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.13 was released on March 19|news/version_3.13]].

* Tails 3.14 is [[scheduled for May 14|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.13:

- Add support for the Bopomofo input method for Chinese using the
  *Chewing* library and improve support for the Pinyin input method.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11292]])

- Save a backup of the configuration of the persistent storage every time it is
  modified. ([[!tails_ticket 16461]])

  This will help us understand and solve why sometimes all the settings of the
  persistent storage disappear. ([[!tails_ticket 10976]])

- Prevent *Additional Software* from downloading packages that are already
  saved in the persistent storage. ([[!tails_ticket 15957]])

- Fix the localization of *Tor Launcher*, the application to configure a Tor
  bridge or a local proxy.
  ([[!tails_ticket 16338]])

- Fix accessibility when opening *Tor Browser* from a desktop notification.
  ([[!tails_ticket 16475]])

- Fix *WhisperBack* crashing when additional APT repositories is configured.
  ([[!tails_ticket 16563]])

Code
====

- We agreed on a list of languages that we want to support
  out-of-the-box in Tails and started implementing it. The [[*Additional
  Software*|doc/first_steps/additional_software]] feature will make it possible
  for other users to add their favorite dictionaries and language packs while
  making our USB image a bit smaller for everybody. ([[!tails_ticket 15807]],
  [[!tails_ticket 16095]], [[!tails_ticket 9956]])

- We identified another possible cause for partially applied
  automatic upgrades. ([[!tails_ticket 16603]])

- We coordinated with the Tor Browser team regarding their upcoming 8.5
  major release and its implications for Tails.

- We continued deprecating *Tails Installer* from
  Debian and Ubuntu.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We improved how installation and upgrade instructions are linked from
  our release notes and download pages. ([[!tails_ticket 16470]])

- We documented [[how to run Tails from a USB image in
  `virt-manager`|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/virt-manager#usb_image]],
  which is the only virtualization solution that allows to use a
  persistent volume in a virtual machine.

User experience
===============

- We drafted how to explain Tails in a new
  homepage and about
  page and tested it with 5 people with
  the help from [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/).
  ([[!tails_ticket 16536]])

- We analyzed the [success metrics of *Additional Software* and the
  integration of
  *VeraCrypt*](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190326.173900.138d9b45.en.html):

  - Both features probably participated in getting our boot stats to
    increase again (20% more since September 2019).
  - Both features didn't change much the tech-savviness of our user
    base.
  - The number of people who use *VeraCrypt* in Tails almost doubled.

  Results are good but we expected more. We need to improve how we let
  the world know about new features.

- We analyzed the [success metrics for USB
  images](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20190331.183400.d3d2350c.en.html):

  - The percentage of people using Tails from macOS at least doubled
    since 3.12.
  - USB images account for 76% of our downloads and our download buttons
    are hit 3970 times a day on average.

- We created a new version of our logo that can be used
  with or without tagline. ([[!tails_ticket 14835]])

  [[!img contribute/how/promote/material/logo/tails-logo-flat.svg link="no" size="300x"]] [[!img contribute/how/promote/material/logo/tails-logo-flat-notagline.svg link="no" size="300x"]]

- We documented *Kazam* instead of *recordMyDesktop* to [[record
  screencasts when doing usability
  testing|contribute/how/user_experience/recording#screencast]] because
  it is more reliable.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Partially applied incremental upgrades cause all kinds of trouble ([[!tails_ticket 14754]])

1. persistence.conf lost, recoverable by reconfiguring ([[!tails_ticket 10976]])

Infrastructure
==============

- We started making plans to migrate to GitLab.

- We interviewed 2 candidates for our open sysadmin position.

- We made good progress on switching to better maintained Puppet
  modules. ([[!tails_ticket 15510]])

- We worked on the software configuration of the prototype node for
  our next-generation CI hardware. ([[!tails_ticket 15501]])

- We fixed our LimeSurvey security updates monitoring system.
  ([[!tails_ticket 15466]])

- We stopped having public monthly meetings in favor of internal stand-up
  meetings.

Funding
=======

- We documented how to [[donate in cash|donate]].

- We explained on our donation page [[why we don't accept donations in
  more cryptocurrencies|donate#other-cryptos]].

- We updated the statistics on [[how we spend our
  money|donate#expenses]].

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

- 2 of us attended a [Debian Bug Squashing
  Party](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2019/03/fr/Paris) in Paris on March
  30&ndash;31.

On-going discussions
====================

- We started a [discussion about possible security implications that
  would arise from shipping the code of the Verification Extension in
  our website instead](http://lists.autistici.org/message/20190320.132313.7c24cc99.en.html).
