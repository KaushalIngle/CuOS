As part of our current donation campaign, we recently explained [[why we
need donations|many_hands_make_tails]] and [[what we accomplished this
year|what_we_accomplished_in_2017]]. Today we are sharing with you some
of our plans for the next years:

### Applications and features

- **Tails Server**: run onion services from Tails (VoIP chat rooms,
  collaboration tools, web servers, messaging servers, etc.)
  ([[!tails_ticket 5688]], [[!tails_blueprint tails_server desc="Blueprint"]]).
  (Planned for early 2018.)
- **VeraCrypt support in GNOME**: graphical utilities to mount VeraCrypt
  volumes ([[!tails_ticket 11684]], [[!tails_ticket 6337]],
  [[!tails_blueprint veracrypt desc="Blueprint"]]). (Planned for late
  2018.)
- **Graphical interface for the Additional Packages persistent
  feature**: allow users to customize which applications are available
  in their Tails ([[!tails_ticket 14568]],
  [[!tails_blueprint additional_software_packages desc="Blueprint"]]). (Planned for
  late 2018.)

### User research and support

- **Power our help desk with a request tracker** to know better how to
  help our user base at large ([[!tails_ticket 9803]],
  [[!tails_blueprint RT_for_help_desk desc="Blueprint"]])
- **Web translation platform** We have received a grant from Lush
  Digital fund to set up a translation platform for our website. This
  platform shall make it easier for translators to translate our
  documentation, and to have our website translated into more languages
  ([[!tails_ticket 10034]]). (Planned for late 2018.)

### Better adoption

- **Rethink the installation and upgrade process** in depth and reflect
  on the future of *Tails Installer*, the installation on Windows and
  macOS, and automatic upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 11679]])
- **Give some love to our troubleshooting documentation**:
  - Our [[known issues page|support/known_issues]] ([[!tails_ticket
    11665]])
  - Computers with unsupported Wi-Fi devices, very common on Mac
    ([[!tails_ticket 11683]])

### Resistance to remote exploitation

- **Persistent Tor state** to have persistent entry guards
  ([[!tails_ticket 5462]], [[!tails_blueprint persistent_Tor_state desc="Blueprint"]])
- **Persistent seed for random number generator** to have stronger
  crypto ([[!tails_ticket 7675]],
  [[!tails_blueprint randomness_seeding desc="Blueprint"]])
- **Have critical parts of Tails audited** ([[!tails_ticket 14508]])

These are all items that we find important and want to prioritize. But making
them a reality will require lots of work, time, and money; on top of all the
day-to-day work that we do to simply keep Tails alive.

If you want us to get there faster, please take one minute to make a donation.
