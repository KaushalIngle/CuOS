<h1 id="tor-connection"><i>Tor Connection</i> assistant</h1>

Tails 4.20 completely changes how to connect to the Tor network from Tails.

After connecting to a local network, a *Tor Connection* assistant helps you
connect to the Tor network.

[[!img doc/anonymous_internet/tor/tor-connection.png link="no" alt=""]]

This new assistant is most useful for users who are at high risk of physical
surveillance, under heavy network censorship, or on a poor Internet connection:

- It protects better the users who need to go unnoticed if using Tor could look
  suspicious to someone who monitors their Internet connection (parental
  control, abusive partner, school or work network, etc.).

- It allows people who need to connect to Tor using bridges to configure them
  without having to change the default configuration in the Welcome Screen.

- It helps first-time users understand how to connect to a local Wi-Fi network.

- It provides feedback while connecting to Tor and helps troubleshoot network
  problems.

We know that this assistant is still far from being perfect, even if we have
been working on this assistant since February.  If anything is unclear,
confusing, or not working as you would expect, please send your feedback to
<tails-dev@boum.org> (public mailing list).

This first release of the *Tor Connection* assistant is only a first step. We
will add more improvements to it in the coming months to:

- Save Tor bridges to the Persistent Storage ([[!tails_ticket 5461]])

- Help detect when Wi-Fi is not working ([[!tails_ticket 14534]])

- Detect if you have to sign in to the local network using a captive portal
  ([[!tails_ticket 5785]])

- Synchronize the clock to make it easier to use Tor bridges in Asia
  ([[!tails_ticket 15548]])

- Make it easier to learn about new Tor bridges ([[!tails_ticket 18219]],
  [[!tails_ticket 15331]])
