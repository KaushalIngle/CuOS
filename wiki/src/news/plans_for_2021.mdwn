In 2021, we want to focus on improving some of the very core features of Tails,
especially for **censorship circumvention**.

To support our work in 2021, take a minute now to
<a href="https://tails.boum.org/donate/?r=pt">donate and fight surveillance and censorship</a>!

Censorship circumvention
------------------------

We want to completely redesign how to **start Tor and configure Tor bridges**.

This will make it easier for people in countries where accessing Tor is blocked
to circumvent censorship. According to data from the Tor project, the top 5
countries by users of Tor bridges are Russia, Iran, the US, Belarus, and China.

Persistent Storage
------------------

We want to improve the interface of the **Persistent Storage settings**.

Improving the Persistent Storage was your top priority when we surveyed our
users in July. We want to start by improving the usability of its core
features and rewriting this 9-year-old Perl application
into Python GTK+. This will make it possible to improve it faster in the
future.

We also want to make it possible to persist Tor bridges.

Security and maintenance
------------------------

To improve the security of all applications in Tails, we want to **migrate to
<em>Wayland</em>**. *Wayland* is a new display system for Linux that better
controls how each application interacts with the rest of the system.

For example, *Wayland* will fix how the [[*Unsafe Browser* can be used to
deanonymize you|doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser#security]].

We will also release **Tails 5.0**, based on Debian 11 (Bullseye) at the end of
2021. It will bring new versions of most of the software included in Tails.
