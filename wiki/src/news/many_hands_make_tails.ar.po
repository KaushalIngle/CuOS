"We've all become used to get content and tools on the Internet without "

"the new product. While sharing images and messages online, users generate "

"Last year we've made it clear [[how much of our overall budget came from "
"government grants|news/why_we_need_donations]] and that, in order to remain "
"independent and to use our money in the best interest of our users, we "
"needed to be able to rely on donations. Our first donation campaign was a "
"big success in that regard: your donations covered nearly one third of our "
"budget of 2017."

"Our yearly expenses equal 230.000 â‚¬ on average since 2015 - which is a very "

"**Many hands make Tails: If each of our users gave $15, our budget for the "
"whole year would be raised within one day.** If we could fund Tails entirely "
"through donations by our users, this would make us independent from "
