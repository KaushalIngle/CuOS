# What's new in 4.0~beta1?

Tails 4.0 will be the first version of Tails based on Debian 10
(Buster). As such, it upgrades essentially all included software.

We are particularly interested in detecting new problems with the following
hardware:

- Mac computers
- Recent Nvidia and ATI/AMD graphics cards

Other changes in Tails 4.0~beta1 include:

- Replace *KeePassX* with [*KeePassXC*](https://keepassxc.org/). ([[!tails_ticket 15297]])

- Add support for Thunderbolt devices. ([[!tails_ticket 5463]])

  If you have a Thunderbolt device, please try using it.

  Choose <span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Devices</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Thunderbolt</span></span> from the
  <span class="application">Settings</span> utility to authorize your
  Thunderbolt devices, if needed.

  See also the design document on [Thunderbolt 3 in Fedora
  28](https://christian.kellner.me/2018/04/23/the-state-of-thunderbolt-3-in-fedora-28/)
  to see how Thunderbolt is integrated in GNOME.

- Remove *Scribus*. ([[!tails_ticket 16290]])

  *[[Additional Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]* feature.

  bookmarks. ([[!tails_ticket 15895]])

obvious ways, but it might still contain undiscovered issues.
