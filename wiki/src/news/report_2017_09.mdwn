Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.2 was released on Tuesday 26|news/version_3.2]] (major release).

* Tails 3.3 is [[scheduled for November 16|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.2:

- We added support for PPPoE and dial-up Internet connections.

- We installed [*BookletImposer*](http://kjo.herbesfolles.org/bookletimposer/)
  to convert linear PDF documents into booklets, and vice-versa.

- We added *GNOME Screen Keyboard* to replace *Florence*, the previous virtual
  keyboard, which had [many issues](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&set_filter=1&f%5B%5D=cf_18&op%5Bcf_18%5D=%3D&v%5Bcf_18%5D%5B%5D=On-screen+keyboard&f%5B%5D=subject&op%5Bsubject%5D=%7E&v%5Bsubject%5D%5B%5D=Florence&f%5B%5D=fixed_version_id&op%5Bfixed_version_id%5D=%3D&v%5Bfixed_version_id%5D%5B%5D=294&f%5B%5D=&c%5B%5D=status&c%5B%5D=priority&c%5B%5D=fixed_version&c%5B%5D=subject&c%5B%5D=category&c%5B%5D=cf_15&c%5B%5D=assigned_to&c%5B%5D=cf_9&group_by=&t%5B%5D=).

- We now require an 8 GB USB stick to install Tails. 4 GB USB sticks that are
  already installed can still be upgraded.

- *Tails Installer* now detects when the target USB stick has Tails
  installed already and automatically proposes to upgrade.
  This made possible to remove the initial splash screen.

- Disabled *Bluetooth* to protect against the [*BlueBorne*
  attack](https://www.armis.com/blueborne/). [[!tails_ticket 14655]].

- Now deny access to the D-Bus service of *Pidgin* to prevent other applications to
  access and modify its configuration. [[!tails_ticket 14612]].

- Fixed the import of secret OpenPGP keys in *Password and Keys*
  [[!tails_ticket 12733]].

Code
====

- We've continued to work on making Tails ISO images reproducible:
  - We fixed all of the issues that were identified by our first build testers.
  - So far, everyone who tried reproducing the Tails 3.2~rc1 ISO
    image succeeded. We've received a couple non-reproducibility reports about
    3.2, and they are all explained by a single, one-byte mistake in a
    translation of the wiki we ship inside Tails (we'll add sanity checks
    so we never release something with that type of mistake again).
  - We published a blueprint which explains how we did it.

- We are improving integration of the _Orca screen reader_ and the
  _GNOME screen keyboard_ into Tails ([[!tails_ticket 14752]],
  [[!tails_ticket 8260]]). A discussion about the screen reader's user
  experience has been [[!tails_ticket 14713 desc="initiated"]] by
  Pablo Natalino, and intrigeri [[!gnomebug 788369 desc="started"]]
  a discussion upstream about the long-press delay for typing special
  chars with it.

- We have formalized how the AppArmor profile for _Thunderbird_ is
  maintained in Debian and upstream. This clarifies where and how our
  contributions should be submitted and at the end of the day this
  should avoid the need to maintain a Tails-specific delta.

- We are working on fixing _Seahorse_ buggy interfacing with
  _pinentry-gtk2_ upstream ([[!gnomebug 787543]], [[!debbug 869416]]).
  A workaround was applied in Tails 3.2 already but we try hard to
  stick to our [[contribute/relationship_with_upstream]] statement.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We updated our [[roadmap|contribute/roadmap]] with our priorities for
  the next years.

- We greatly improved our [[instructions for building the Tails ISO
  image|contribute/build/]] and created a new section about how to
  [[verify that the Tails ISO image is
  reproducible|contribute/build/reproducible/]].

- We are documenting the process for Tails contributors to request
  sponsorship when attending events on behalf of Tails, in order to
  improve fairness and to streamline how the simplest cases are handled.
  This documentation should land on our website by the end of the year.

- We documented hardware limitations for Tails on [[Intel Atom Cherry
  Trail tablets|support/known_issues#cherry-trail]].

User experience
===============

- We designed a [[new download page|install/download]], to prepare for
  the migration of our verification extension to *Web Extensions*. We
  started drawing sketchy
  wireframes,
  then improved them incrementally after testing them on paper with
  users, and finally implemented the resulting prototype in
  HTML.

- We benchmarked open source web applications to survey our user
  base. The best candidate is
  *LimeSurvey*
  and we will do a test deployment in October as part of a user research
  on the use of *VeraCrypt*.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. [[!tails_ticket 14755 desc="Tails Installer treats drives differently depending on when they are plugged"]].

1. [[!tails_ticket 14250 desc="Applications menu stops working some times"]].

1. [[!tails_ticket 14754 desc="Keyboard and mouse do not work after upgrading to Tails 3.2"]].

1. Many people had problems to use their Persistent Volume and had to reconfigure to access it.

Infrastructure
==============

- We finished upgrading all our systems to Debian Stretch
  ([[!tails_ticket 12160]]).
- We upgraded our Redmine instance ([[!tails_ticket 11808]]).

Funding
=======

- We sent a thank you email to everybody who donated in 2016.

- We signed a new contract with OTF that will run from September 1,
  2017 to August 31, 2018 and that covers mainly:
  - [[!tails_ticket 14468 desc="VeraCrypt support in GNOME: make it easier to integrate Tails into workflows with other users and operating systems"]]
  - Additional software: make it easier to tailor Tails to specific
    needs for sensitive data manipulation ([[!tails_ticket 14568]],
    [[!tails_ticket 5551]] and friends)

- We worked on making our Sponsors page easier to translate
  ([[!tails_ticket 12646]]).

Outreach
========

Upcoming events
---------------

* Some of us will attend the
  [Reproducible Builds summit](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/berlin2017/)
  in Berlin (October 31 to November 2).

* Many Tails people will be at the
  [34th Chaos Communication Congress, aka. 34C3](https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2017/34C3-in-leipzig)
  in Leipzig (December 27 to December 30).

On-going discussions
====================

- Tails reproducibility keeps being an important topic on our mailing list
- We have been busy with a new download page

Press and testimonials
======================

* The 5th version of the [Guide d'autodéfense numérique](https://guide.boum.org) was released. This book proposes ways to understand how the digital world functions, what solutions can we organise against certain types of attacks, and which tools can help do that.
