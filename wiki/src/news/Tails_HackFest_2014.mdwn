The first Tails [HackFest](https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/HackFest_2014_Paris/),
which took place on July 5-6 in Paris, was a great event: about 120 people
attended on Saturday, 70 people on Sunday. We shared some good workshops,
some very good food, and homemade beer in a nice and friendly atmosphere.

The slides of some talks have been
[published](https://tails.boum.org/promote/slides/), but there is more
to come.

The first Tails stickers were distributed and you can also make your
own!

We are particularly happy that the HackFest attracted very different
people, so we were a quite diverse assembly. Probably thanks to our
anti-harassment policy
(thanks Genma for the French translation)...

Some people talked about the HackFest:

(please send links!)
