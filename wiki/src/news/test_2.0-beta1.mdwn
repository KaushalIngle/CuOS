You can help Tails! The first beta for the upcoming version 2.0 is
out. We are very excited and cannot wait to hear what you think about
it :)

[[!toc levels=1]]

# What's new in 2.0?

Tails 2.0 will be the first version of Tails based on DebianÂ 8
(Jessie). As such, it upgrades essentially all included software.

The most noticeable change is probably the move to GNOME Shell,
configured in *Classic mode*. This desktop environment provides a modern
and actively developed replacement for the aging GNOME "Flashback".
GNOME Shell also paves the way for better supporting touchscreens in
the future.

Under the hood, an amazing amount of code was ported to more modern
technologies. This, in turn, allowed us to do lots of small changes
all around the place, that will make the Tails experience both
safer, and more pleasant. For example, all custom system services
are harder to exploit thanks to the use of Linux namespaces, set up by
systemd. And the way Tails tells the user that "Tor is ready" is now
more accurate.

But really, there are simply too many changes to describe them all
here, so just try Tails 2.0~beta1 yourself!

Technical details of all the changes are listed in the
Changelog.

There is only one piece of bad news, that makes us a bit sad, though: we
had to remove the Windows camouflage feature, since our call for help
to port it to GNOME Shell (issued in January, 2015) was unsuccessful.
