Tails summit
============

Five developers met for our annual summit. The summit was less dense
than last year but still very productive. See the [[detailed
report|news/summit_2013]].

Releases
========

There was no release in July. Tails 0.20 is
planned
for the 9th of August.

Metrics
=======

- 151Â 657 connections of Tails to the Tor network. This makes a boot
  every 17.7 seconds on average. This is an approximation from the
  requests made to the security announcements feed when Tails is
  connected to Tor.

- 77 non-empty bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

Code
====

- We had two low-hanging fruits sessions, that were mostly used to
  review and merge pending branches.

- A lot of work has been done to migrate to Debian Wheezy:

- A first build of Tails based on Debian Wheezy version was tested,
  and many bugs [[!tails_ticket 6015 desc="were identified"]].

- The work on AppArmor was
  continued. An early upstream patch that aims to add support
  for stacked filesystems [[!tails_ticket 6199 desc="was tested"]].

- The included Linux kernel was
  updated to 3.10-1.

- A deprecation wrapper for Truecrypt was
  written. Many thanks to Julien
  Voisin for providing patches.

- Dasher, a graphical predictive text input system, was
  installed.

- The Wikileaks IRC server address was
  tentatively fixed. Many thanks to Julien
  Voisin for providing patches. User interface issues have prevented us from
  merging this branch yet.

- Claws mail will
  no more display a
  dialog box when sending a message. Many thanks to matsa for
  providing a patch.

- Many
  improvements to additional software have been merged.

- A bunch of improvements to our test suite were proposed and
  reviewed.

Documentation and Website
=========================

- The [[Promote|contribute/how/promote]] page was [[!tails_gitweb_commit
  c8f80ebb18a6077feacbf00e7c31a19a99b22648 desc="fully rewritten"]].

- A new page [[Website|contribute/how/website]] on how to improve the
  Tails website was [[!tails_gitweb_commit
  fb9135c3ba1cbb974f9ab3bf596d17ce03803e4a desc="added to the contribute
  section"]].

- The page [[Translate|contribute/how/translate]] was
  reworked in
  depth to match our new translation workflow using either Git or
  Transifex.

- The [[Pidgin|doc/anonymous_internet/pidgin]] documentation was
  was fully rewritten.

- The [[homepage|index]] was
  rephrased to mention Internet circumvention.

- Our Tor enforcement policy was [[!tails_gitweb_commit
  e0dba123f20e0df72ac723510b6fba093a1a29d7 desc="clarified"]] on the
  [[About|about]] page.

- The OpenPGP signature to verify the ISO images is now
  served directly
  by our website.

- A prototype conversion of our test suite to use
  native ruby + rjb instead of JRuby was pushed to Git.

Localization and Internationalization
=====================================

- All Tails strings but the website are now translatable in Transifex.
- i18nspector was uploaded to wheezy-backports.

Infrastructure
==============

- Our todo list items were migrated to Redmine.

- Blueprints were extracted from our old todo section into the new
  Blueprint section to store our research and plans in a
  static form outside of Redmine.

- Criterion to flag a task as easy were
  [[identified|contribute/working_together/criteria_for_starter_tasks]] as
  a way to orientate better new contributors.

- Our roadmap was updated and we defined our objectives for Tails 1.0,
  1.1, 2.0, and 3.0:
  
  - [Tails 1.0](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap#Tails 1.0): feature parity with Incognito
  - [Tails 1.1](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap#Tails 1.1): Tails based on Debian Wheezy
  - [Tails 2.0](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap#Tails 2.0): Sustainability and maintainability
  - [Tails 3.0](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap#Tails 3.0): Hardening and better security

- We started working on making our infrastructure more reliable:
  [[!tails_ticket 6185 desc="looking for a system"]] that could act as
  a fail-over for our main server.

Funding
=======

- A short-term funding with sponsor Bravo has been tentatively confirmed and
  redefined, but not signed yet.

- The contracts for the bounty program are still being signed. But some
  work has already been done and tested on Seahorse Nautilus, AppArmor,
  ikiwiki to Redmine, keyringer and libvirt.

- We sent a concept note to answer sponsor Charlie's call
  for proposals.
