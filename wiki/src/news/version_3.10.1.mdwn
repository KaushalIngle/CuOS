# Changes

## Upgrades and changes

- Hide the [[**PIM** option|doc/encryption_and_privacy/veracrypt#parameters]]
  when unlocking *VeraCrypt* volumes because *PIM* won't be supported until
  Tails 4.0. ([[!tails_ticket 16031]])

- Rename the buttons in the confirmation dialog of *Tails Installer* to
  **Install** (or **Upgrade**) and **Cancel** to be less confusing.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11501]])

- Update *Linux* to 4.18.

- Update *Tor Browser* to 8.0.3.

- Update *Thunderbird* to 60.2.1.

## Fixed problems

- Prevent *Tor Browser* from leaking the language of the session.
  ([[!tails_ticket 16029]])

- Prevent *Additional Software* from asking to persist packages which are
  already configured as additional software. ([[!tails_ticket 15983]])

- Prevent *Tails Installer* from crashing when issuing an error message with
  international characters (non-ASCII).  ([[!tails_ticket 15166]])

- Fix the *VeraCrypt* support for multiple encryption ([cascades of
  ciphers](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Cascades.html)). ([[!tails_ticket 15967]])

- Harden the configuration of `sudo` to prevent privilege escalation.
  ([[!tails_ticket 15829]])
