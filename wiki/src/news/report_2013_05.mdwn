Releases
========

Tails 0.18 [[was released|news/version_0.18]] on May 18.

Metrics
=======

  - 128Â 676 connections of Tails to the Tor network. This makes a boot
    every 21 seconds on average (this is an approximation from the
    requests made to the security announcements feed when Tails is
    connected to Tor).

  - 51 non-empty bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

  - 630 comments were posted on the forum, with 143 signed by Tails.

  on May 22, that was attended by three persons.

  Q&A website.

On-going discussions

  user.

  funding with sponsor Foxtrot.
