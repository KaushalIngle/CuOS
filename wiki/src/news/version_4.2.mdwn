# Improvements to automatic upgrades

We worked on important improvements to the automatic upgrade feature,
which is still one of your major pain points when using Tails:

- Until now, if your version of Tails was several months old, you
  sometimes had to do 2 or more automatic upgrades in a row.  For
  example, to upgrade from Tails 3.12 to Tails 3.16, you first had to
  upgrade to Tails 3.14.

  Starting with 4.2, direct automatic upgrades will be available from
  all prior versions to the latest version.

- Until now, you could only do a limited number of automatic upgrades,
  after which you had to do a much more complicated [["manual"
  upgrade|doc/upgrade#manual]].

  Starting with 4.2, you will only have to do a manual upgrade between
  major versions, for example to upgrade to Tails 5.0 in 2021.

- We made automatic upgrades use less memory.

- We optimized a bit the size of the download when doing automatic
  upgrades.

# New features

- We included several command line tools used by
  [*SecureDrop*](https://securedrop.org/) users to analyze the metadata
  of leaked documents on computers that cannot use the *[[Additional
  Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]* feature:

  - [*PDF Redact Tools*](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/pdf-redact-tools)
    to redact and strip metadata from text documents before publishing
  - [*Tesseract OCR*](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
    to convert images containing text into a text document
  - [*FFmpeg*](https://ffmpeg.org/) to record and convert audio and video

# Changes and upgrades

- Update *Tor Browser* to 9.0.3.

- Update *Thunderbird* to [68.3.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/68.3.0/releasenotes/).

- Update *Linux* to 5.3.15.

# Fixed problems

- Open *~/Persistent/keepassx.kdbx* by default when starting *KeePassX*.
