[[!toc levels=1]]

# Changes

## Upgrades and changes

- Update *Linux* to 4.19.37 and most firmware packages. This should
  improve the support for newer hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.).

- Enable all available mitigations for the MDS (Microarchitectural Data Sampling)
  attacks and disable [[!wikipedia Simultaneous_multithreading desc="SMT"]]
  (simultaneous multithreading) on all vulnerable processors to fix the
  [RIDL, Fallout](https://mdsattacks.com/) and
  [ZombieLoad](https://zombieloadattack.com/) security vulnerabilities.

- Update *Tor Browser* to 8.5.

- Remove the following applications:

  - Desktop applications
    - *Gobby*
    - *Pitivi*
    - *Traverso*

  - Command-line tools
    - `hopenpgp-tools`
    - `keyringer`
    - `monkeysign`
    - `monkeysphere`
    - `msva-perl`
    - `paperkey`
    - `pwgen`
    - `ssss`
    - `pdf-redact-tools`

  You can install these applications again using the
  *[[Additional Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]* feature.

  Thanks to the removal of these less popular applications in 3.14 and the removal
  of some language packs in 3.13.2, Tails 3.14 is 39 MB smaller than 3.13.

# Known issues

### Tails fails to start a second time on some computers ([[!tails_ticket 16389]])

On some computers, after installing Tails to a USB stick,
Tails starts a first time but fails to start a second time. In some
cases, only BIOS (Legacy) was affected and the USB stick was not listed
in the Boot Menu.

We are still investigating the issue, so if it happens to you, please
report your findings by email to <tails-testers@boum.org>. Mention the
model of the computer and the USB stick. This mailing
list is [archived publicly](https://lists.autistici.org/list/tails-testers.html).

To fix this issue:

1. Reinstall your USB stick using the same installation method.

1. Start Tails for the first time and [[set up an administration
   password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Root Terminal</span>
   </span> to open a <span class="application">Root Terminal</span>.

1. Execute the following command:

   <p class="pre command">sgdisk --recompute-chs /dev/bilibop</p>

You can also test an experimental image:

1. [Download the *.img* file from our development
   server](https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_bugfix-16389-recompute-chs/lastSuccessful/archive/build-artifacts/).

1. Install it using the same installation methods.

   We don't provide any OpenPGP signature or other verification technique
   for this test image. Please only use it for testing.

See the list of [[long-standing issues|support/known_issues]].
