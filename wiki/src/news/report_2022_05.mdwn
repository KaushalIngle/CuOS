Here are a few highlights about what we did in May, among many other things:

- We implemented many improvements to the Tor Connection assistant.
  This makes is much easier for people in Asia to circumvent censorship.
  For details, see the [[Tails 5.1 release notes|version_5.1]].

- We wrote a new homepage for the *Unsafe Browser* when you are not connected
  to the Tor network yet. This new version makes it easier to understand how to
  sign in to the network using a captive portal.

- We started organized training and usability tests sessions for August
  in Brazil.

- [[Tails 5.0 was released on May 3|news/version_5.0]].
  It was the first version of
  Tails based on DebianÂ 11 (Bullseye) and brought new versions of a lot of
  the software included in Tails and new OpenPGP tools.

- We started evaluating Mirrorbits to manage our download mirror pool. On top of
  decreasing the required maintenance work, this should make downloads of Tails
  faster and more reliable.

- Tails has been started more than 769&#8239;997 times this month. This makes
  24&#8239;838 boots a day on average.
