Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.9 was released on September 5|news/version_3.9]] (major release).

* Tails 3.10 is [[scheduled for October 23|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.9:

### Additional Software

You can now install additional software automatically when starting Tails.

When installing an additional Debian package from Tails, you can decide to
install it automatically every time.

To check your list of additional software packages, choose
**Applications**&nbsp;▸ **System Tool**&nbsp;▸ **Additional Software**.

[[Read our documentation on installing additional software.|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]

### VeraCrypt integration

To unlock *VeraCrypt* volume in Tails, choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **System
Tool**&nbsp;▸ **Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes**.

The integration of *VeraCrypt* in the *Files* and *Disks* utilities was done
upstream in GNOME and will be available outside of Tails in Debian 10 (Buster)
and Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish).

[[Read our documentation on using *VeraCrypt* volumes.|doc/encryption_and_privacy/veracrypt]]

### News reading in *Thunderbird*

*Thunderbird* is now the official RSS and Atom news feed reader in Tails.

*Liferea* will be removed from Tails in version 3.12, early 2019.

### Other changes

- Improve the configuration of the persistent storage to make it easier
  to scroll and consistent with the GNOME guidelines.

### Included software

- Update *Tor Browser* to 8.0, based on *Firefox* 60 ESR.

  - Based on [*Firefox Quantum*](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/).

- Update *Thunderbird* from 52 to [60](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/60.0/releasenotes/).

- Update *Tor* to 0.3.4.7-rc.

- Update *Electrum* to from 3.0.6 to [3.1.3](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES).

### Hardware support

The following updates make Tails work better on recent hardware (graphics,
Wi-Fi, etc.):

- Update *Linux* to 4.17 which also fixes the
  [Foreshadow](https://foreshadowattack.eu/) attack.

- Update the *DRM* and *Mesa* libraries to improve support for some graphics
  cards.

- Update the Intel and AMD microcodes and most firmware packages.

### Fixed problems

- Stop displaying the *Enigmail* setup wizard every time Tails is restarted.
  ([[!tails_ticket 15693]] and [[!tails_ticket 15746]])

- Show a spinner while starting *Tor Browser*, *Tails documentation*, and
  *WhisperBack*. ([[!tails_ticket 15101]])

- Use *Tor Browser* again for browsing the documentation offline.
  ([[!tails_ticket 15720]])

- Show *Synaptic* and *Root Terminal* even when no administration
  password is set. ([[!tails_ticket 11013]])

- *Tails Installer*

  - Link to upgrade documentation when upgrading. ([[!tails_ticket 7904]])
  - Hide the **Reinstall** option when the USB stick is too small. ([[!tails_ticket 14810]])
  - Correct the size of the USB stick in the confirmation dialog when reinstalling. ([[!tails_ticket 15590]])

Code
====

- We successfully collaborated with the _Tor Browser_ team to fix
  a severe issue with _Tor Browser_ 8.0 in Tails, that was discovered
  shortly before the Tails 3.9 release. Thanks a lot to everyone
  who helped!

- We fixed a number of regressions that were introduced in Tails 3.9, such as:
  - Fix the update of *Additional Software*. ([[!tails_ticket 15978]])
  - Fix opening VeraCrypt file containers using the **Open With Unlock VeraCrypt
    Volumes** of *GNOME Files*. ([[!tails_ticket 15954]])
  - Fix the display of the **General** tab in the preferences of *Tor Browser*.
    ([[!tails_ticket 15917]])
  - Fix displaying the help of *GNOME Videos*. ([[!tails_ticket 15841]])

Documentation and website
=========================

- We updated our [[documentation on *Tor
  Browser*|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser]] to *Tor Browser* 8.

- We added [Nothing2Hide](https://nothing2hide.org/) as an organization
  providing Tails training.

User experience
===============

- We did some stats on the amount of RAM on computers sending us *WhisperBack*
  reports.

  Between 5&ndash;10% of our users seem to have less than 3 GiB of RAM.

Infrastructure
==============

- We started planning the migration of our Redmine to [[!tails_ticket
  15918 desc="a different hostname"]] and [[!tails_ticket 15919
  desc="a new VM"]].

- We wrote a number of automated tests to ensure we notice important
  regressions in the _VeraCrypt_ support introduced in Tails 3.9.

- We completed our [[!tails_ticket 14585 desc="investigation"]] of
  Dogtail's long-term viability. Our conclusion is that we can keep
  using it, should start contributing to the maintenance of the
  package in Debian, but invest as little as possible into Dogtail
  for now as our long-term concerns are not fully addressed.

- We investigated what prevented us from giving more Tails developers
  access to our Jenkins CI platform so far. We've identified
  a [[!tails_ticket 11344 desc="few"]] [[!tails_ticket 15981
  desc="blockers"]], resolved them, and started giving such access
  more liberally. This should make Tails development work more
  pleasurable and efficient for a few more people.

- The Tails sysadmin team discussed hiring a new team member, the
  profile of the person we will be looking for, and how we could share
  our work with them.

- We made great progress towards [[!tails_ticket 14588 desc="hosting
  our website on our own infrastructure"]]. The final steps and migration
  should happen by the end of the year.

Funding
=======

- We published our [[finances for 2017|doc/about/finances#2017]].

- We prepared our end-of-year donation campaign and will launch it in the
  coming weeks.

- We added the postal address of RiseupLabs to our donation page as a way of
  [[receiving US checks|donate#check]].

- We removed Flattr as a donation method because it is not worth it
  (raised ~200€ in 3 years).

Outreach
========

Past events
-----------

- emmapeel, intrigeri, and sajolida attended the Tor meeting in Mexico City.

- sajolida gave a talk about Tails, user research, and free software
  culture at the colloquium [Mecanismos de Privacidad y Anonimato en
  Redes](https://priv-anon.unam.mx/) of UNAM, Mexico.
  ([slides](https://un.poivron.org/~sajolida/unam.pdf))
