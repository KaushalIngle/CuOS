[[!tag announce]]

Tails 4.0 will be the first version of Tails based on Debian 10
(Buster). It brings new versions of most of the software included in
Tails and some important usability and performance improvements.

You can help Tails by testing the release candidate for the upcoming version 4.0!

We are very excited about it and cannot wait to hear your feedback :)

# Changes and upgrades

## Major changes to included software

- Update *Tor Browser* to 9.0a7, based on Firefox 68.1.0esr.

- Update *Electrum* to 3.3.8, which works with the current Bitcoin network.

- Update *Linux* to 5.3.2.

- Update *tor* to 0.4.1.6.

## Usability improvements to *Tails Greeter*

We improved various aspects of the usability of *Tails Greeter*,
especially for non-English users.

- To make it easier to select a language, we curated the list of
  proposed languages by removing the ones that had too little
  translations to be useful.

- We also simplified the list of keyboard layouts.

- We fixed the **Formats** setting, which was not being applied.

- We prevented additional settings to be applied when clicking on
  **Cancel** or **Back**.

# Fixed problems

- Fix the delivery of *WhisperBack* reports. ([[!tails_ticket 17110]])

- Dozens of other problems — literally. For more details, read our
  [changelog](https://salsa.debian.org/tails-team/tails/blob/testing/debian/changelog).

# Known issues

- Spellchecking only works for English. ([[!tails_ticket 17150]])

  To fix it, set `spellchecker.dictionary_path` to `/usr/share/hunspell`
  in `about:config`.

- *Unsafe Browser* tabs have the "Private Browsing" name and the *Tor
  Browser*'s icon. ([[!tails_ticket 17142]])

- The *On-screen keyboard* does not allow to input any accentuated char.
  ([[!tails_ticket 17021]])
