"Unlike most other tools on the Internet, Tails comes for *free* as in "
"*freedom*. We are not selling your data, sending you targeted advertising, "
"nor will ever sell our project to a big company. We give out Tails for free "
"simply because everybody deserves to be protected from surveillance and "
"censorship. But also because being free software is a necessary requirement "
"for our tools to be safe, and protect you as intended. If our source code "
"was closed, there would be no way of actually verifying that our software is "
"trustworthy."

"We often hear complaints about the fact that many software projects that are "
"meant to fight surveillance, like Tor and Tails, get a lot of funding from "
"the US government whose own surveillance projects are severely criticized. "

"From anonymized statistics on our website we know that Tails is used by "
"around 18 000 people every day. **If each of them gave 12€, the price of a "

"As you can see, funding Tails through donations is a realistic and our "

"agencies running the surveillance business."
