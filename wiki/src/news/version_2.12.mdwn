# Changes

## New features

- We installed again *GNOME Sound Recorder* to provide a very simple
  application for recording sound in addition to the more complex *Audacity*.
  Sound clips recorded using *GNOME Sound Recorder* are saved to the *Recordings* folder.

## Upgrades and changes

- We removed [*I2P*](//geti2p.net/), an alternative anonymity network, because
  we unfortunately have failed to find a developer to maintain *I2P* in Tails.
  Maintaining software like *I2P* well-integrated in Tails takes time and
  effort and our team is too busy with other priorities.

- Upgrade *Linux* to 4.9.13. This should improve the support for newer
  hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.).

For more details, read our [[!tails_gitweb debian/changelog desc="changelog"]].

# Known issues

- The video application Totem [[!tails_ticket 12457 desc="may crash Tails"]].
  You can work around this problem by installing *VLC*.

See the list of [[long-standing issues|support/known_issues]].
