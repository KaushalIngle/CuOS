## Upgrades and changes

- Add support for the Bopomofo input method for Chinese using the
  *Chewing* library and improve support for the Pinyin input method.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11292]])

  [[!img bopomofo.png link="no"]]

  If you still have problems typing in Bopomofo or Pinyin, please let us
  know on <tails-testers@boum.org> (public mailing list) or
  <tails-bugs@boum.org> (private email).

- Save a backup of the configuration of the persistent storage every time it is
  modified. ([[!tails_ticket 16461]])

  This will help us understand and solve why sometimes all the settings of the
  persistent storage disappear. ([[!tails_ticket 10976]])

- Update *Tor* to 0.3.5.8.

- Update *Thunderbird* to 65.1.0.

- Update the Intel microcode to 3.20180807a.2, which fixes more
  variants of the Spectre, Meltdown, and Level 1 Terminal Fault (L1TF)
  vulnerabilities.

## Fixed problems

- Prevent *Additional Software* from downloading packages that are already
  saved in the persistent storage. ([[!tails_ticket 15957]])

- Fix the localization of *Tor Launcher*, the application to configure a Tor
  bridge or a local proxy.
  ([[!tails_ticket 16338]])

# Known issues

### Electrum is outdated and cannot connect to servers

<a id="electrum-phishing"></a>

<p><strong><span class="application">Electrum</span> in Tails cannot connect
anymore to Electrum servers.</strong></p>

<p>The version of <span class="application">Electrum</span> in Tails is
vulnerable to a <a href="https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/4968">phishing
attack that tricks people in updating to a malicious version of
<span class="application">Electrum</span></a> which is not distributed from the
official Electrum website.</p>

<p><strong>You are safe unless you try to do the malicious update
manually.</strong></p>

<p>To prevent this phishing attack, all trustworthy
<span class="application">Electrum</span> servers now prevent
older versions from connecting to them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, newer versions of <span class="application">Electrum</span>
are not available in Debian and cannot be integrated easily in Tails. Given the
lack of maintenance of Electrum in Debian, we are still
<a href="http://lists.autistici.org/message/20190319.170700.b3b5bf1f.en.html">assessing
what is best to do in Tails</a>.</p>

<p>Until then, your wallet is not lost and you can restore it from its seed
using an <a href="https://electrum.org/#download">up-to-date version of
Electrum</a> outside of Tails.</p>

### Tails fails to start a second time on some computers ([[!tails_ticket 16389]])

On some computers, after installing Tails to a USB stick,
Tails starts a first time but fails to start a second time. In some
cases, only BIOS (Legacy) was affected and the USB stick was not listed
in the Boot Menu.

We are still investigating the issue, so if it happens to you, please
report your findings by email to <tails-testers@boum.org>. Mention the
model of the computer and the USB stick. This mailing
list is [archived publicly](https://lists.autistici.org/list/tails-testers.html).

To fix this issue:

1. Reinstall your USB stick using the same installation method.

1. Start Tails for the first time and [[set up an administration
   password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Root Terminal</span>
   </span> to open a <span class="application">Root Terminal</span>.

1. Execute the following command:

   <p class="pre command">sgdisk --recompute-chs /dev/bilibop</p>

You can also test an experimental image:

1. [Download the *.img* file from our development
   server](https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_bugfix-16389-recompute-chs/lastSuccessful/archive/build-artifacts/).

1. Install it using the same installation methods.

   We don't provide any OpenPGP signature or other verification technique
   for this test image. Please only use it for testing.
