Releases
========

* [[Tails 4.10 was released on August 25|news/version_4.10]].

* Tails 4.11 is [[scheduled for September 22|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 4.10:

* Update Linux to 5.7.10. This should improve the support for newer hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.).

* Hide the welcome message when starting Thunderbird.

* Fix support for USB Wi-Fi adapters with Atheros AR9271 hardware. ([[!tails_ticket 17834]])

* Fix USB tethering from iPhone. ([[!tails_ticket 17820]])

Code
====

- Added support for older TREZOR firmware ([[!tails_mr 142]]).

- Started working on the upgrade to Thunderbird 78 ESR,
  and in particular its new OpenPGP support ([[!tails_ticket 17148]]).

- Automated generation of our Changelog ([[!tails_ticket 17886]]).

- Automated generation of the security advisory boilerplate from a template that
  technical writers can improve ([[!tails_mr 128]]).

- Hidden broken "Turn on Wi-Fi Hotspot" feature in GNOME Wi-Fi settings
  ([[!tails_ticket 17887]]).

- Fixed sorting Intel GPUs last in the "Error starting GDM" message
  ([[!tails_ticket 17903]]).

- Upgraded Linux to 5.7.17-1 ([[!tails_ticket 17895]]).

Documentation and website
=========================

- Changed massively our instructions on how to start Tails:

  1. Documented [[Shift + Restart on Windows|install/windows#restart]]. ([[!tails_ticket 16456]])

     We're not telling Windows users to use the Boot Menu key anymore.

     It's still the default for [[Linux|install/linux#restart]].

  2. Wrote dedicated pages for starting Tails on [[PC|doc/first_steps/start/pc]] and
     [[Mac|doc/first_steps/start/mac]].

  3. Simplified troubleshooting sections.

     We simplified and made consistent the [[troubleshooting instructions|install/windows#troubleshooting]]
     in all installation scenarios.

  4. Removed instructions to report to Help Desk from the installation
     scenarios but kept them on [[doc/first_steps/start|doc/first_steps/start/pc/#help-desk]].

  We believe that all these changes will lower your workload and make
  more people start Tails at the same time.

- Rephrased our [[FAQ about VPN|support/faq#vpn]]. ([[!tails_ticket 15783]])

- Wrote an [[FAQ about 32-bit computers|support/faq#32-bit]]. ([[!tails_ticket 17866]])

- Fixed all outdated links to torproject.org. ([[!tails_ticket 17717]])

- Used ikiwiki's automatic referencing of HTML ids in table of content
  on the pages that have the longest tables of content. ([[!tails_ticket 17844]])

  Now you can copy links directly from the table of content to point to:

User experience
===============

- Analyzed the responses of the [[!tails_blueprint desc="OpenPGP and Pidgin survey" user_survey#openpgp-pidgin]]. ([[!tails_ticket 17821]])

  It's pretty exciting because we barely have quantitative data about
  our user base at large.

  Highlights:

  * Our users find Tails relatively easy to use compared to an industry
    average.

  * Linux users are still the biggest share of the respondents and this
    hasn't changed much since 2017.

  * The top 5 wishes of our users are, in rough order:

    1. Do nothing because Tails is great already :)

    2. More persistent settings: security level in Tor Browser,
       background, keyboard, and language

    3. Messaging applications and voice calls

    4. Make Tor less painful for web browsing

    5. Better upgrades

  * OpenPGP is much more popular outside Thunderbird: 49% vs. 16%.

  * Enigmail users are more technical than OpenPGP users overall.

  * Electrum (28%) is more used than Thunderbird (27%), which is more used than XMPP (17%).

  * IRC is used by a non-negligible 8% of respondents.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

This last month we felt that the social crisis created by covid is starting
to take a toll on our users mental state, and we received
more derailed emails than usual. Hopefully there are local resources you
can count on for this difficult times. Take care!

1. Many users wrote to us with problems related to MacbookPros from 2020.

   Apple in general does not prioritize collaborating with Free Software
   projects, and their newest hardware is usually very hard for Free Software
   developers to get working with Linux, and thus Tails. In comparison,
   hardware for PC tends to be more open and get support for Linux faster.
   Please take that into consideration if you are buying hardware to run Tails.

1. The last release also saw some users with graphics cards issues. Please
   read [[the page shown on the error message|https://tails.boum.org/gdm]]
   before mailing us, because there might be a solution for your graphics card.

1. Some users [[!tails_ticket 17908 desc="had problems"]] to do automatic
   upgrades to Tails 4.10. Update: this was fixed.

Infrastructure
==============

- Set up infrastructure that will allow Release Managers to upload to
  `git-annex` faster ([[!tails_gitlab tails/sysadmin/-/issues/17687]]).

- Started coordination for requiring Buster or newer for running our test suite
  ([[!tails_ticket 17842]]).

- Started upgrading our Jenkins "isotester" workers to Buster.

- [[!tails_blueprint desc="Summed up" CI_usability]] the findings from "Gather usability data
  about our current CI" ([[!tails_ticket 16959]]).

Funding
=======

Grants
------

- Our grant to [Reset](https://reset.tech/) from May 1 was rejected.

- We applied to [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net/support/cpf/call-for-applications)
  to work on usability improvements for censorship circumvention.

Donations
---------

- We [[!tails_blueprint desc="surveyed lapsed donors" donation_process#survey]] who haven't
  donated since 2019 and analyzed 121 responses. Conclusions:

  * We're doing good! Negative comments were few exceptions in a mass of
    love: the work that we do is very important and we do it well.

  * We should communicate a bit more and better with past donors:

    - The main reason for lapsed donors not to renew their donation is
      lack of awareness.
    - We should write a newsletter to donors half-way through the year
      or when we have major improvements.
    - Adding an opt-in mechanism for our newsletter would allow us to be
      less shy to write them.
    - LimeSurvey is more convenient to send mass emails to donors.
    - We should communicate more about the impact of donations and how
      we spend the money.

  * About our donors and their interests:

    - Donors are mostly users (74%) but they are really into helping
      others (70%).

    - Donors mostly talk about:

      * Privacy (24)
      * Protection from oppressive governments and persecution (18)
      * Liberty and freedom of speech (16)

- We merged a first batch of improvements to our [[Donate|donate]] page:

  * To better explain our mission:

    - We wrote new slogans.
    - We improved the text on the left.

  * To better explain how we spend our money:

    - We simplified the chart and added short text to explain each of
      maintenance, improvements, user experience, and administration.
    - We added a section about our impact with numbers of daily users.

  * To increase trust:

    - We duplicated the recommendations from the Home page.
    - We improved the color scheme of the charts.

Sponsors
--------

- We added Freiheitsfoo as sponsor.
