*amnesia* is now to be called *The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System*.

The Incognito author [has declared it to be
dead](http://www.anonymityanywhere.com/incognito/) on March 23, 2010,
and written that *amnesia* "should be considered as its spiritual
successor". He adds that "there's been some talk of making it the new
Incognito even by name". It did happen.

A new release will happen soon, that will not only reflect the name
change, but also fix a bunch of annoying bugs and bring a few
new features.
