# Known issues

- Due to [an issue in *Tor
  Browser*](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/24243), the
  documentation shipped in Tails doesn't open in *Tor Browser* anymore
  and lacks our sidebar. The warning page of the
  *Unsafe Browser* also lacks graphical design. ([[!tails_ticket 14962]])
- Starting Tails 3.3 from DVD takes more than twice as long as earlier
  releases. ([[!tails_ticket 14964]])
