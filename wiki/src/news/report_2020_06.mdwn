Releases
========

[[Tails 4.7 was released on June 2|news/version_4.7]]:

- Make the installation of Additional Software more robust. ([[!tails_ticket 17278]])

- Clarify the error message when entering an incorrect password to unlock a
  VeraCrypt volume: *Wrong passphrase or parameters* instead of *Error
  unlocking volume*. ([[!tails_ticket 17668]])

- Clean up confusing comments in `/etc/tor/torrc`. ([[!tails_ticket 17706]])

[[Tails 4.8 was released on June 30|news/version_4.8]]:

- We disabled the *Unsafe Browser* by default and clarified that [[the
  *Unsafe Browser* can be used to deanonymize
  you|doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser#security]].

- We added a new feature of the Persistent Storage to save the settings
  from the Welcome Screen.

  This feature is beta and only the additional setting to enable the
  *Unsafe Browser* is made persistent. The other settings (language,
  keyboard, and other additional settings) will be made persistent in
  Tails 4.9 (July 28).

- Fix the *Find in page* feature of *Thunderbird*. ([[!tails_ticket
  17328]])

  with the Tails USB stick removed. ([[!tails_ticket 16787]])

  spoofing|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/mac_spoofing]] fails and the
  network interface is disabled. ([[!tails_ticket 17779]])

- Fix the import of OpenPGP public keys in binary format (non armored)
  from the *Files* browser.

Tails 4.9 is [[scheduled for July 28|contribute/calendar]].

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. A lot of people complained about having trouble starting Tails with
[AMD/ATI] Renoir GPUs, but it seems that a kernel update [[!tails_ticket
17759#note_152260 desc="fixed that problem in Tails 4.8"]].

1. Some MacBook users reported that [[!tails_ticket 17775 desc="Tails
fails to boot with some recent MacBooks"]]. A workaround was proposed
but people were then affected by their [[!tails_ticket 17791 desc="key
combinations"]] or [[!tails_ticket 13576 desc="mouse and keyboard"]] not
being supported by GRUB.

1. There were still a couple of users reporting having problems to
[[!tails_ticket 17183 desc="import public PGP keys in Seahorse"]].

Infrastructure
==============

- Decommissioned the system that used to host our Redmine.

- Made it possible for core community members to propose changes to our GitLab
  configuration with a merge request. ([[!tails_ticket 17753]])

Funding
=======

- Submitted a full proposal to the
  [OTF Core Infrastructure Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/funds/core-infrastructure-fund/)
  to improve the user experience of
  [[!tails_blueprint desc="connecting to Tor" network_connection]] and using Tails to
  circumvent censorship.
