This release fixes [[many security
vulnerabilities|security/Numerous_security_holes_in_4.10]]. You should upgrade as soon as possible.

[[!toc levels=1]]

# New features

- We added a new feature of the Persistent Storage to save the settings
  from the Welcome Screen: language, keyboard, and additional settings.

  To restore your settings when starting Tails, unlock your Persistent Storage
  in the Welcome Screen.

# Changes and updates

- Update *Tor Browser* to [10.0](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-100).

- Update *Thunderbird* to [68.12](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/68.12.0/releasenotes/).

- Update *Linux* to 5.7.17. This should improve the support for newer
  hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.).

- Configure *KeePassXC* to use the new default location *Passwords.kdbx*. ([[!tails_ticket 17286]])

- Update <span class="code">python3-trezor</span> to 0.12.2 to add
  compatibility with the new Trezor Model T.

# Fixed problems

- Disable the feature to **Turn on Wi-Fi Hotspot** in the Wi-Fi settings
  because it doesn't work in Tails. ([[!tails_ticket 17887]])
