Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.14 was released on May 21|news/version_3.14]] (bugfix release).

* Tails 3.15 is [[scheduled for July 9|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 3.14:

- Enable all available mitigations for the MDS (Microarchitectural Data Sampling)
  attacks and disable [[!wikipedia Simultaneous_multithreading desc="SMT"]]
  (simultaneous multithreading) on all vulnerable processors to fix the
  [RIDL, Fallout](https://mdsattacks.com/) and
  [ZombieLoad](https://zombieloadattack.com/) security vulnerabilities.

- Remove the following applications:

  - Desktop applications
    - *Gobby*
    - *Pitivi*
    - *Traverso*

  - Command-line tools
    - `hopenpgp-tools`
    - `keyringer`
    - `monkeysign`
    - `monkeysphere`
    - `msva-perl`
    - `paperkey`
    - `pwgen`
    - `ssss`
    - `pdf-redact-tools`

  You can install these applications again using the
  *[[Additional Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]* feature.

  Thanks to the removal of these less popular applications in 3.14 and the removal
  of some language packs in 3.13.2, Tails 3.14 is 39 MB smaller than 3.13.

- Add back the *OpenPGP Applet* and *Pidgin* notification icons to the top
  navigation bar.

- Fix *NoScript* being deactivated when restarting *Tor Browser*.

  <div class="note">
  <p>*NoScript* is removed from the set of icons displayed by default in
  *Tor Browser*. This is how *Tor Browers* looks in Tails 3.14.</p>

Code
====

- We spent lots of time dealing with the Firefox add-ons fiasco,
  also known as "armagadd-on 2.0". [[!tails_ticket 16694]]

- Finally, most of our patches improving the security of Thunderbird's
  email configuration wizard were merged and will be part of Thunderbird
  68, that is: they'll be shipped not just in Tails, but to all
  Thunderbird users on any operating system! [[!tails_ticket 6156]]

- We sent out a new call to test a fix for the issue in which
  [[!tails_ticket 16389 desc="16389: Some USB sticks become unbootable
  in legacy BIOS mode after first boot"]]. We received a few conclusive
  test results.

- We tested Onionshare 2.0 in Tails and decided to ship it in 4.0.

Documentation and website
=========================

- We explained better what are [[captive
  portals|/doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser]].

- We documented how to install additional [[language packs and
  dictionaries|doc/first_steps/additional_software#language-packs]].

- We replaced the PNG of the pie chart that we have on "[[How we spend
  our money|donate#expenses]]" with pure SVG code, directly in the
  HTML.
  It makes it lighter to download, more accessible and much easier to
  update and translate.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

The first two weeks, before the release of Tails 3.14, we had users reporting

1. [[!tails_ticket 16608 desc="#16608: Disable the topIcons GNOME Shell extension" ]]
1. [[!tails_ticket 16447 desc="#16447: Regression on some Intel GPU (Braswell, Kaby Lake)"]]

Then, after the release, the changes on Tor Browser made many users report to us

1. [[!tails_ticket 16746 desc="#16746: document the disappearence of NoScript and HTTPSEverywhere icons from Tor Browser's toolbar"]]
1. [[!tails_ticket 16762 desc="#16762: Document why NoScript last update is january 2000"]]

Infrastructure
==============

- We finished benchmarking the prototype node for
  our next-generation CI hardware. ([[!tails_ticket 15501]])

Funding
=======

  the installation on macOS and Windows. This work was supported through
  a grant from The ISC Project.

  campaign](http://lists.autistici.org/message/20190503.174100.f523ad84.en.html).

- We wrote a thank you email to everybody who donated in 2018.

- We added a permanent incentive to donate on the homepage of Tor
  Browser in Tails.
  It's only displayed 10% of the time.

- We got sponsored by *The Best VPN*. Thank you for your
  generous donation!
