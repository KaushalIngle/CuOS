You can help Tails by testing the second beta for the upcoming version 4.0!

We are very excited about it and cannot wait to hear your feedback :)

# What's new in 4.0~beta2?

Tails 4.0 will be the first version of Tails based on DebianÂ 10
(Buster). As such, it upgrades essentially all included software.

We are particularly interested in detecting new problems with the following
hardware:

- Mac computers
- Recent Nvidia and ATI/AMD graphics cards

Other changes in Tails 4.0~beta2 include:

- All changes [[included in 4.0~beta1|news/test_4.0-beta1]].

- All changes [[included in Tails 3.16|news/version_3.16]].

- Update *Linux* to 5.2.9. This mitigates the Spectre v1 swapgs
  security vulnerability.

- Update *tor* to 0.4.1.5.

- Update *Enigmail* to 2.0.12.

- Make the *GNOME Desktop* load faster.

- Save about 250 MB of RAM.

- In the *Applications* menu, move *Calculator* and *Terminal* to
  where they were in Tails 3.x. This avoids the need to scroll in the
  *Utilities* submenu.

- Allow *OnionShare* to open links with *Tor Browser*.

- Use the same icon for Tails Documentation in the *Applications* menu
  as on the *Desktop*.

Technical details of all the changes are listed in the
[Changelog](https://salsa.debian.org/tails-team/tails/blob/devel/debian/changelog).

# Known issues in 4.0~beta2

* Tails 4.0~beta2 cannot always be built reproducibly ([[!tails_ticket 17023]]).
  The difference we've observed is minor and has no security impact.

* [Open tickets for Tails 4.0](https://redmine.tails.boum.org/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=279)

* [[Longstanding known issues|support/known_issues]]

# How to test Tails 4.0~beta2?

We will provide security upgrades for Tails 4.0~beta2 like we do for regular
versions of Tails.

Keep in mind that this is a test image. We tested that it is not broken in
obvious ways, but it might still contain undiscovered issues.

Please, report any new problem to <tails-testers@boum.org> (public mailing list).
