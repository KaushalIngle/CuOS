Releases
========

* [[Tails 2.12 was released on April 19th|news/version_2.12]] (major release).

* Tails 3.0 is [[scheduled for June 13th|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 2.12:

- We installed again *GNOME Sound Recorder* to provide a very simple
  application for recording sound in addition to the more complex
  *Audacity*. Sound clips recorded using *GNOME Sound Recorder* are
  saved to the *Recordings* folder.

- We removed [*I2P*](//geti2p.net/), an alternative anonymity network,
  because we unfortunately have failed to find a developer to maintain
  *I2P* in Tails. Maintaining software like *I2P* well-integrated in
  Tails takes time and effort and our team is too busy with other
  priorities.

- Upgrade *Linux* to 4.9.13. This should improve the support for newer
  hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.).

Documentation and website
=========================

- Cody Brownstein documented how to [[change the password of an encrypted
  partition|doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes#change]].

- Cody Brownstein documented how to delete the files corresponding to a
  persistence feature that has been deselected.

- We added instructions on how to burn DVDs from macOS *El Capitan* or
  later.

User experience
===============

- We collected intercept interviews
  of users using Tails world-wide to better understand our users, their needs,
  and what they like or dislike in Tails. We already have seven great story
  from Western Europe, North America, Latin America, and Africa.

Infrastructure
==============

- We upgraded some of our systems to Debian 9 (Stretch), in order to
  help identify remaining issues before it becomes the new Debian stable
  release.

- We made good progress towards using our Vagrant build system on our
  Continuous Integration infrastructure, to make it match what
  developers use. This is part of our work on Reproducible ISO Builds.

- We are interviewing a candidate to join our system administration team.

- The mechanism that we designed for the [[distribution and activation of the
  revocation certificate of the Tails signing
  key|doc/about/openpgp_keys/signing_key_revocation]] is now deployed and 23
  people own a share of the revocation certificate. It allows revoking the
  Tails signing key even if very bad things happens to most of the team while
  making it hard for isolated and malicious individuals to revoke the signing
  key when not needed. We still encourage experts to review this mechanism and
  other projects to adopt similar practices.

Funding
=======

- We are working towards adding a [[!tails_ticket 6972 desc="sponsors
  page"]] to our website, and are talking with a couple potential
  corporate sponsors.

- We are still in the process of discussing our proposal with OTF, and
  reworking it accordingly.

- We were nominated for the [MIT Media Lab Disobedience
  Award](https://www.media.mit.edu/disobedience/).
