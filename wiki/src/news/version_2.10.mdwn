issues|security/Numerous_security_holes_in_2.9.1]] and users should
upgrade as soon as possible.

[[!toc levels=1]]

# Changes

## New features

  - We installed [[*OnionShare*|doc/anonymous_internet/onionshare]],
    a tool for anonymous file sharing.

    [[!img version_2.10/onionshare.png link="no"]]

  - We enabled the
    [[circuit view|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#circuit-view]]
    in *Tor Browser*.

    [[!img doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/circuit-view.png link="no"]]

## Upgrades and changes

  - Upgrade *Tor* to 0.2.9.9.

  - Upgrade *Tor Browser* to 6.5.

  - Upgrade *Linux* to 4.8. This should improve the support for newer
    hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, etc.)

  - Upgrade *Icedove* to 45.6.0.

  - Replace *AdBlock Plus* with *uBlock Origin*.

  - Configure the *APT* package manage to use Debian's Onion services.

  - Install the *AMDGPU* display driver. This should improve the
    support for newer AMD graphics adapters.

  - Renamed the *Boot Loader Menu* entries from "Live" to "Tails", and
    replaced the confusing "failsafe" wording with "Troubleshooting
    Mode".

  - Add support for [[!wikipedia exFAT]].

  - Remove *Nyx* (previously called *arm*).

  - Rewrite *Tor control port filter* entirely. Now Tails can safely
    support *OnionShare*, the circuit view of *Tor Browser*, and
    similar. This also enabled Whonix to replace their own similar
    piece of software with this one.

## Fixed problems

  - Made *OnionCircuits* compatible with the *Orca* screen reader.
