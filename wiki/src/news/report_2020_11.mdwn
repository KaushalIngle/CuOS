Releases
========

* [[Tails 4.13 was released on November 17|news/version_4.13]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 4.13:

* Update Thunderbird from 68.12 to 78.4.2. Thunderbird 78 replaces the Enigmail extension with built-in support for OpenPGP encryption. If you used Enigmail before Tails 4.13, follow [[our instructions to migrate from Enigmail to Thunderbird 78|https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/thunderbird/openpgp_migration/index.en.html]].

* Add a button to restart Tails at the end of creating the Persistent Storage. ([#16384](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/16384))

* Only include translations for languages that are available in the Welcome Screen. This reduces the size of the download by 5%. ([#17139](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/17139))

* Make the root directory of the Persistent Storage only readable by the root user. ([#7465](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/7465))

* Users of the Dotfiles feature of the Persistent Storage can choose Places â–¸ Dotfiles to open the /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles folder in the Files browser.

* Enable TCP timestamps. This might increase stability on slower Internet connections. ([#17491](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/17491))


Release management
------------------

A year ago, when we learned we had to switch to a 4-weeks release cycle to
follow Mozilla's lead, we acknowledged that the need to streamline our release
process, in order to make this part of our work more sustainable. In November,
the Tails Release Managers team had a sprint focused on this very topic, during
which we identified a great number of issues and fixed most of them! :)

For details, read the [sprint
report](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20201116.132555.7bc56b9c.en.html).

Code
====

- We had a meeting to prioritize & organize work on our next big things.
  We decided to first focus on:

  - Wayland blockers, that can be addressed incrementally.

  - Deal with deprecation of Tor Launcher ([[!tails_ticket 17215]])

  - Rewrite Persistent Storage GUI frontend ([[!tails_ticket 17803]]

- We scheduled a sprint in January to bootstrap our work on the RIPE
  grant and on Wayland blockers.

- We re-bootstrapped our experiment on sharing our team's "front desk" workload.

- We started reorganizing our team meetings.

- We now require Debian 10 "Buster" or newer for running our test suite
  ([[!tails_ticket 17842]]), and started to take benefit from this change.

- We automated a great part of the tests we do as part of release
  quality assurance.

Documentation and website
=========================

- Planned the [[!tails_ticket 16128 desc="deprecation of the Tails
  Verification extension"]].

- Documented how to use [[GMail in
  Thunderbird|doc/anonymous_internet/thunderbird#gmail]].
  ([[!tails_ticket 17879]])

- Explained why is a [[bad idea to use an old version of
  Tails|support/faq#older-version]] in the FAQ. ([[!tails_ticket 18001]])

- Recommended [[doing backups|install/windows#recommendations]] at the end of
  our installation instructions. ([[!tails_ticket 18000]])

- Decided to remove */support/learn*. ([[!tails_ticket 17920]])

- Updated our doc to Thunderbird 78 and wrote [[migration
  instructions|doc/anonymous_internet/thunderbird/openpgp_migration]].
  ([[!tails_ticket 17147]])

User experience
===============

- Published improved consent documents for user research: ([[!tails_ticket 16534]])

  * [Consent form](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/ux/-/raw/master/tools/consent_form.fodt)
  * [Research information sheet](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/ux/-/raw/master/tools/research_information_sheet.fodt)

- Cleaned our user research data for 2021/2022. ([[!tails_ticket 17409]])

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. [[!tails_ticket 17955 desc="Touchpad and keyboard do not work in Asus computers"]]
1. [[!tails_ticket 17807 desc="Some users lost their OpenPGP keys but could recover them from the backup file"]]
1. [[!tails_ticket 17987 desc="Panda Wireless adaptors stopped working"]]

Funding
=======

- The first numbers that we could analyze for the donation campaign look
  very promising compared to the same period last year:

  * PayPal: 34% more donations, 28% more money
  * Bitcoin: 62% more donations
  * Monero: 205% more donations

- We programmed our biggest Twitter campaign ever: 34 tweets, 1 tweet
  every 2 days at most. Half of them are not direct calls to donate but
  rather build up on the new  Home and About pages to talk about the
  main properties of Tails.

- We decided not to blog about the donation campaign for now because our
  team is seriously overworked. It doesn't seem to have impacted the
  campaign significantly. We might still blog about achievements and
  plans in December.

- Our grant to RIPE on [improving Tails for censorship
  circumvention](https://www.ripe.net/support/cpf/funding-recipients-2020)
  was approved.
