Releases
========

Tails 0.19 [[was released|news/version_0.19]] on June 26.

Metrics
=======

- 140Â 517 connections of Tails to the Tor network. This makes a boot
  every 18.5 seconds on average (this is an approximation from the
  requests made to the security announcements feed when Tails is
  connected to Tor).

- 66 non-empty bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

- 110 comments were posted on the forum, with 32 signed by Tails,
  before we closed it.

Code
====

- Tails was upgraded
  to Linux 3.9.

- The feature/set-wireless-devices-state
  branch was merged, eventually.

- We tried to get in touch with the WiNoN developers. No reply so far.

- Many branches were merged just in time for the 0.19 freeze.

- Two
  serious
  bugs were
  discovered while testing 0.19~rc1, and fixed for 0.19 final.
  This reinforces our conviction that we should run our test suite
  automatically as soon as possible.

- Some solutions to get rid of the JRuby
  mess were
  experimented with.

- Access restriction to ptrace was
  updated for the upcoming
  Debian kernel.

- The Iceweasel warning when leaving HTTPS
  was disabled. Thanks to
  winterfairy for the initial patch.

- The wrong search
  engine bug
  was fixed.

- Git over HTTPS was
  fixed.

- All Pidgin protocols but IRC and Jabber/XMPP
  were disabled.

- The WhisperBack help
  was partly updated.

- Information about Alsa
  was added to
  WhisperBack reports.

- The "remember additional packages" feature was
  adapted to work with newer live-boot.

Documentation and Website
=========================

- We closed the forum.

- We decided not to follow Tor to StackExchange yet. We need more time
  to decide what we will do, now that our previously preferred option
  was discarded.

- The release process was automated a bit. So was our custom Iceweasel
  package release process.

Localization and Internationalization
=====================================

- Our POT files were
  merged first, and then we
  intltoolize'd our translation system.
  This should help pushing these strings to Transifex.

On-going discussions
====================

- Flashproxy

- Accessibility for blind and visually impaired users

- Making the boot medium read-only

- Wrong MIME type returned for ISO signatures

- Download over HTTP by default?

- Network fingerprint

Infrastructure
==============

- Our Git repositories are now all hosted in a central
  place
  ([[documentation|contribute/git]]). Thanks a lot to immerda.ch for
  their continued support!

- We worked on improving backups for our infrastructure.

Funding
=======

- We kept working on funding with sponsor Foxtrot.

- We are working on short-term funding with sponsor Bravo.

- The way we will contract bounty hunters was rebooted. Stay tuned.
