"Even without building anything new in Tails, publishing our **releases** "
"every 6 weeks is a lot of work as it also implies fixing the problems found "
"in previous versions, documenting the changes, migrating to newer versions "
"of Debian, GNOME, and Tor Browser, and making sure that the **foundations** "
"of Tails stay relevant. As the schedule of emergency releases is "
"unpredictable, they are hard to fund through grants and we instead usually "
"rely on donations."
