User experience
===============

### Interviews of Tails users

We published 4 new interviews:

- 2 from people attending 34C4: [[Daan|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/daan]] and
  [[Charles|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/charles]].

- 4 from journalists from Latin America: [[Joana and Orlando|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/joana_orlando]] and
  [[Claudia and Felix|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/claudia_felix]].

### Additional Software

We designed the interactions and interfaces for people to install
additional software every time Tails is started.

Like for our work on VeraCrypt in
December, we did that
through paper prototyping and formative testing with users in Berlin.

Here are the most visible parts of this upcoming feature.

When installing a Debian package:

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

<a id="electrum"></a>

1. *Electrum* users were very stressed about [vulnerability found in Electrum
in January](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/3374). Tails is not
affected as [[!tails_ticket 15151 desc="our firewall blocks the connections
required to exploit this vulnerability"]]. Still, we will update *Electrum* in
Tails 3.6.

1. Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities made our users restless.

1.  [[!tails_ticket 15254 desc="Tails Installer breaks in locales other
than the default"]] was a hard one, although on the other side we see
again that many people use Tails in another language than English.

1.  [[!tails_ticket 15116 desc="Nvidia Maxwell and Pascal graphic cards
are still giving problems in Tails 3.5."]]

1. As every time we update the Tails signing key, many users got scared by
the gpg messages received during OpenGPG ISO verification, but there are
several tickets open about this [[!tails_ticket 14711]], [[!tails_ticket
13634]],  [[!tails_ticket 14977]].

Strategic planning
==================

We published notes on strategic planning
sessions that we had in August to
organize future discussions.

Infrastructure
==============

- We made plans to finish migrating all our download mirrors to
  HTTPS.

- We updated almost all the Puppet modules we use. ([[!tails_ticket 15154]])

- We started working on migrating our infrastructure to Puppet 4.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11834]])
