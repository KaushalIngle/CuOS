January has been a busy month with two releases including Tails 2.0.

[[!toc]]

Releases
========

* [[Tails 1.8.2 was released on January 10, 2016|news/version_1.8.2]] (minor release).

* [[Tails 2.0 was released on January 26, 2016|news/version_2.0]] (major release).

* The next release (2.2) is [[planned for March 08|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 2.0:

- Tails now uses the <span class="application">GNOME Shell</span> desktop
  environment, in its <span class="application">Classic</span> mode.
  <span class="application">GNOME Shell</span> provides a modern, simple, and
  actively developed desktop environment. The <span class="application">Classic</span>
  mode keeps the traditional <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>,
  <span class="guimenu">Places</span> menu, and windows list. Accessibility and
  non-Latin input sources are also better integrated.

- Update <span class="application">Tor Browser</span> to 5.5 (based on Firefox 38.6.0 ESR):
  - Add Japanese support.

- Remove the Windows camouflage which is currently broken in GNOME Shell.
  We started working on [[!tails_ticket 10830 desc="adding it back"]] but [[your
  help is needed|news/windows_camouflage_jessie]]!

- Change to `systemd` as init system and use it to:
  - Sandbox many services using Linux namespaces and make them harder to exploit.
  - Make the launching of Tor and the memory wipe on shutdown more robust.
  - Sanitize our code base by replacing many custom scripts.

- Update most firmware packages which might improve hardware compatibility.

- Notify the user if Tails is running from a non-free virtualization software.

- Remove <span class="application">Claws Mail</span>, replaced by
  <span class="application">Icedove</span>, a
  rebranded version of <span class="application">Mozilla Thunderbird</span>.

- HiDPI displays are better supported. ([[!tails_ticket 8659]])

- Remove the option to open a download with an external application in Tor
  Browser as this is usually impossible due to the AppArmor confinement.
  ([[!tails_ticket 9285]])

- Close <span class="application">Vidalia</span> before restarting Tor.

- Allow <span class="application">Videos</span> to access the DVD drive.
  ([[!tails_ticket 10455]], [[!tails_ticket 9990]])

- Allow configuring printers without administration password.
  ([[!tails_ticket 8443]])

Code

  volume. Testing is welcome!

  Camouflage.

Documentation and website

User experience

* Tails Installer is now available in [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/tails-installer)
  and [Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~tails-team/+archive/ubuntu/tails-installer)

Infrastructure
==============

* Our test suite covers 208 scenarios, 17 more than in August. We focused on
  making our test suite more robust.

* The infrastructure to run our test suite on all the ISO images built
  automatically from development branches has been deployed, but still needs
  adjustments.

* In January 757 ISO images were automatically built and tested by our
  continuous integration infrastructure.

* We have a prototype for a monitoring
  system based on Icinga2,
  for our services.

Outreach
