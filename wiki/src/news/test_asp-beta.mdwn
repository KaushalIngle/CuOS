feature is ready for testing.
We are very excited.

# What's new in the Additional Software feature Beta?

We've designed and implemented a user interface to select additional software
packages and make additional software persistent.

Users are now able to decide, for each additional piece of software that they
might install in Tails once, whether it shall be installed automatically in the
future.

# How to test Tails Additional Software feature Beta?

1. Download and install the ISO image on a USB stick, start from the stick and
   configure a persistent volume. Reboot and use the package manager to install a
   package currently not in Tails (example: Mumble).
   Note that in order to carry out these steps you need to set up a root
   password in the Tails Greeter.

1. Configure if you want this package to be installed automatically on
   each boot.

1. Restart Tails and use Mumble (or another program you've just installed).

1. Imagine that over time you have installed several additional programs
   (Mumble, VLC, etc.) but donâ€™t remember the exact list. How would you check
   your list of additional software?

1. How would you stop installing Mumble every time you start Tails?

We are interested in your feedback on bugs and usability of this feature.

- Are there any notifications that are not clear?
- Did you run into technical issues?
- Were you able to to modify the installation details as asked in the last
  question?
- Do you have ideas on packages that we should propose to Tails users for
  installation?

Please send feedback emails to tails-testers@boum.org.
