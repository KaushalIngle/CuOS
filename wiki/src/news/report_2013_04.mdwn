Releases
========

Tails 0.17.2 [[was released|news/version_0.17.2]] on April 9th.

Metrics
=======

  - 121Â 183 connections of Tails to the Tor network. This makes a boot
    every 21 seconds on average (this is an approximation from the
    requests made to the security announcements feed when Tails is
    connected to Tor).

  - 71 bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

  - 984 comments were posted on the forum, with 76 signed by Tails.
    This means there has been much more activity on the forum, and that
    we are having a hard time coping with it, but also that anonymous
    contributors are providing more and more good answers without our
    help.

Code
====

- We had a highly successful "low-hanging fruits"
  week:
  at least 16 tickets were touched, and at least five persons attended
  one session or more.

- The persistence feature to remember installed packages
  (has
  matured a lot) and should be ready for Tails 0.18.

- Support for Obfs3 bridges (has been added).

- Torbutton 1.5.x
  can now be included in Tails. We also reorganized and cleaned
  our iceweasel prefs to look a bit more like the ones from TBB.

- GNOME accessibility themes
  were installed to provide
  high contrast and large print themes.

- The "About GNOME" menu entry
  has been customized to provide
  information about the running version of Tails.

- A
  branch is ready to disable wireless devices other than
  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, WWAN, and WiMAX by default.

- Some initial work
  was done to not start the
  browser automatically anymore.

- The audio preview when having the mouse pointer on an audio file in
  Nautilus
  has been disabled.

- The support for non-obfsproxy proxy
  has been fixed.

- IPv6 is not disabled
  anymore. It turns out that the IPv6 leaks we wanted to fix actually
  don't exist.

- GNOME screenshot
  has been installed.

Documentation and Website
=========================

- "Getting started..." is now the homepage for the Tails documentation
  accessible from the desktop.

- The content of the /bugs section of the website was moved to /todo.

- A bug concerning *MD5 Reborned Hasher* has been documented.

- The instructions for manual installation on
  Mac have been brought
  back online and the instructions for Linux and Windows have been
  improved.

- The introduction of the [[bug reporting
  instructions|/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]] have been improved.

Translation
===========

- A solution was proposed to distribute [[translation
  workflows|/contribute/how/translate]] in either Git or Transifex.

- Tails USB installer: update translations for Arabic, German, Greek, Spanish,
  Farsi, Finnish, Italian, Latvian, Dutch, Polish, and Chinese.

- WhisperBack: update translations for Arabic, German, Greek, Spanish,
  Euskera, Finnish, Italian, Korean, Latvian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese,
  Russian, Swedish, Chinese  Spanish, Korean, Polish, and Russian. New

On-going discussions
====================

- Debian derivatives &
  DebConf13,
  about what we can propose for [DebConf13](http://debconf13.debconf.org/)

- secure and simple network time
  (hack),
  about tlsdate, a possible segmentation fault and its future in Tails

- Discussion on
  minitube,
  about replacing minitube with smtube

- GNOME proxy settings,
  again,
  about dropping all GNOME proxy settings

Infrastructure
==============

- Tails 0.17.2 was the first release assisted with automated tests!
  * Cucumber is used to describe the tests to perform.
  * 82 tests have been written so far

- Huge progress was
  made
  on our automatic building infrastructure, based on Jenkins.

Funding
=======

- The grant application we did with
  [OpenITP](http://openitp.org/?q=openitp_first_round_of_2013_project_funding_now_open_for_proposals)
  (Sponsor Echo) was rejected. But our proposal made it to their
  finalist set.

- We started to work on another grant application for more long-term
  funding with sponsor Foxtrot.

- The list of bounties that are going to be funded through the Tor
  project program is closed. It will be made public soon.
