# Known issues

* The Unsafe Browser cannot connect to the Internet ([[!tails_ticket
  6479]]). This can be workaround'ed by setting
  `network.proxy.socks_remote_dns` to `false` on the
  [about:config](about:config) web page.
* Keyboard shortcuts use QWERTY mapping instead of AZERTY on French
  keyboard ([[!tails_ticket 6478]]). This may impact other keyboard
  layouts as well.
* TorBrowser takes too long to shutdown ([[!tails_ticket 6480]]).
* TorBrowser proposes to share the microphone with websites
  ([[!tails_ticket 6481]]).
* htpdate uses a different User-Agent than the Tor Browser
  ([[!tails_ticket 6477]]).
* The included Linux 3.10-3 (version 3.10.11-1) kernel has a few known
  security issues.
* [[Longstanding|support/known_issues]] known issues.
