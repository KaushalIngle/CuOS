## To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your persistent storage

- Automatic upgrades are broken from Tails 4.14 and earlier.

  Follow our instructions to do an [[automatic upgrade from Tails 4.15, Tails
  4.16, Tails 4.17, or Tails 4.18|doc/upgrade/error/check#4.18]].

- Automatic upgrades are available from Tails 4.19 or later to 4.26.

  You can [[reduce the size of the download|doc/upgrade#reduce]] of future
  automatic upgrades by doing a manual upgrade to the latest version.

- If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an
  automatic upgrade, please try to do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade/#manual]].

  - [[Install from Windows|install/windows]]
