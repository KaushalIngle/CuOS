"Using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP to connect to a website allows you to "
"encrypt your communication with the server. But encryption alone does not "
"guarantee that you are talking with the right server, and not someone "
"impersonating it, for example in case of a man-in-the-middle attack."
msgstr ""
"使用 HTTPS 取代明文的 HTTP 來進行網站連線，可以加密訪客與伺服器之間的通訊。但"
"只有加密並不能保證用戶是和正確的伺服器通話，難保不會有人假借身份，例如在[[中"

"SSL certificates try to solve this problem. A SSL certificate is usually "
"issued by a certificate authority to certify the identity of a server. When "
"you reach a website your web browser might trust an SSL certificate "
"automatically if it trusts the authority that issued it."

"SSL 憑證正試圖克服這個難題，  SSL 憑證通常由憑證授權機關所發以證明某個伺服器"

"自動相信它的 SSL 憑證。"

"Commercial certificate authorities are making a living out of selling SSL "
"certificates; they are usually trusted automatically by most of the "
"browsers.  Other non-commercial authorities, such as [CACert](http://www."

"avoid displaying a security warning when visiting the website."

"商用憑證機構靠出售 SSL 憑證為生，它們往往為大多數瀏覽器所自動信任。其它的非商"
"業授權機構如 [CACert](http://www.cacert.org/)，則需要安裝作業系統或是用戶在訪"
"問該網站時手動來避免顯示安全警告訊息。"

"But this trust system has proven to be flawed in many ways. For example, "
