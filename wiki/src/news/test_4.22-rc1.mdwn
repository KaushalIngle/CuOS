<h1 id="new">What's new in 4.22~rc1?</h1>

Tails 4.22, scheduled for release on September 7, will allow users to
manually set their correct time zone and clock. This helps users to work around
a long-standing issue of Tails not being able to connect to Tor when obfs4
bridges are being used and the computer has a hardware clock that is set to
a time zone that is east of UTC. See [[!tails_ticket 15548]].

Also, Tails 4.22 will allow users to save bridges to Persistent Storage so
that the bridges do not need to be reentered every time Tails is restarted.

<h1>What's new since 4.21?</h1>

- Update *Thunderbird* to [78.13](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/78.13.0/releasenotes/)

- Tor Connection assistant will stop trying to connect to Tor when the error
  screen is displayed.

- Offline documentation includes the Russian language translation.

For more details, read our
[changelog](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/raw/4.22-rc1/debian/changelog).

<h1 id="how-to-test">What to test in Tails 4.22~rc1?</h1>

We particularly would like to know if Tails successfully connects to Tor
using bridges when the correct time zone and clock are set from within Tor Connection
assistant.

Also, we want to make sure that bridges are properly saved to and restored
from Persistent Storage when the Tor Bridges feature is enabled.

Tell us if anything is unclear, confusing, or not working as you would expect.

Please, send your feedback to <tails-testers@boum.org> (public mailing list).

Happy testing!
