  responsive web design.

- Changed our sidebar to a top bar. ([[!tails_ticket 15112]])

  It has a better contrast for accessibility, prevents [[right-rail
  blindess|https://www.nngroup.com/articles/fight-right-rail-blindness]],
  and is more visible on mobile.

Funding
=======

- Sent 2 grant applications:

  * To the [OTF Core Infrastructure
    Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/funds/core-infrastructure-fund/) to
    improve the user experience of [[!tails_blueprint desc="connecting to
    Tor" network_connection]] and using Tails to circumvent
    censorship.

  * To [Reset](https://www.reset.tech/) to integrate mobile messaging
    applications (Signal, Telegram, Wire, Matrix, etc.).

Metrics
=======

* Tails has been started more than 936&#8239;560 times this month. This makes 31&#8239;219 boots a day on average.

  That's 8.7% more than in March and the biggest increase in usage since 2015.
  It's most likely due to the COVID-19 quarantine and people staying at home
  but it might also be a good sign from the support of Secure Boot and an
  easier adoption by new users.
