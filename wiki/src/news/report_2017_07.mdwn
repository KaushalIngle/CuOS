Releases
========

* Tails 3.2 is [[scheduled for October 3|contribute/calendar]].

Documentation and website
=========================

- We improved our installation instructions for
  Ubuntu to configure the PPA through
  **Software & Updates** instead of the command line.

- We published instructions on [[how to repair a Tails
  3.0.1|news/rescue_3.0.1]] broken by the automatic upgrade.

- We documented that Tails fails to start on [[computers with Nvidia
  Maxwell graphics|support/known_issues#nvidia-maxwell]].

- We updated the terminology on our website to stop mentioning SD cards
  and always talk about *Tails USB stick* instead of *Tails device*.
  [[!tails_ticket 9965]]

- We made it clearer in the system requirements that Tails doesn't work
  on handheld devices.

- We improved the link and QR code to get back to the same step when
  switching device during installation. [[!tails_ticket 12319]]

- We updated our command line instructions to use `apt` instead of
  `apt-get`.

- We renamed *Mac OS X* as *macOS*, its new name.

- We improved the inlining mechanism that links to release notes during
  upgrades. [[!tails_ticket 13341]]

Funding
=======

- We received a donation from *ExpressVPN*.

- Our OTF proposal was accepted and we will help us do great work
  between 2017Q4 and 2018Q3:
  - **TrueCrypt support in GNOME**: graphical utilities to mount
    TrueCrypt volumes ([[!tails_ticket 11684]], [[!tails_ticket 6337]])
  - **Graphical interface for the Additional Packages persistent
    feature**: allow users to customize which applications are available
    in their Tails ([[!tails_ticket 5996]] [[!tails_ticket 9059]])

- We started using [CCT, the Center for the Cultivation of
  Technology](https://techcultivation.org/) as our European fiscal
  sponsor for real and are very happy about it. On the long run they
  will help us spend less time doing administrative work and more time
  improving Tails!

- *Next INpact* started a [donation campaign](https://www.nextinpact.com/news/104659-edito-vie-privee-et-securite-nos-donnees-comment-mieux-soutenir-informer-et-proteger.htm)
  to support Tails, Tor and VeraCrypt using 33% of total donations.
