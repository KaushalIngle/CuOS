[[!meta title="Tails report for April, 2015"]]

[[!pagetemplate template="news.tmpl"]]

This report is a bit special: since we release every 6 weeks, there is no release this month. The next one is [[planned for the 12th of May|contribute/calendar]]. Therefore there are no code news, the work being done will be reported when it's released :)

However, like any Free Software project, Tails is not only about the code, so here are the news about the other parts of the project!

[[!toc ]]

Documentation and website
=========================

* We wrote a small documentation about *Claws Mail*.

* We corrected some details in the manual installation documentations, the verification documentation, and [[related FAQ questions|support/faq#unetbootin]].

* We added a [[FAQ entry about why we ship the GNOME Desktop|support/faq#gnome]].

* We added a [[FAQ entry about why we don't sell preinstalled Tails devices|support/faq#preinstalled]].

* We added (yet another) [[FAQ entry about why you shouldn't edit your torrc|support/faq#torrc]].

* ... and various small improvements to the documentation all over the place :)

User experience
===============

- On the ISO verification extension:
  - We started a security discussion about the possible threats **from
    inside the browser**.
    We need your expertise!
  - We finished a [detailed
    wireframe](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/759/extension-20150430.fodg)
    of the various screens of the extension.

- On the web assistant for getting started with Tails:
  - We finished a prototype for the 3rd iteration of the
    router
    (the set of introductory questions) and tested it with several
    people.
  - We started a discussion about several terminology
    issues.
  - We proposed a URL scheme, a
    JavaScript policy,
    and a compatibility list for Mac.

- We published some [[guidelines for user testing|contribute/how/user_experience/testing]].
