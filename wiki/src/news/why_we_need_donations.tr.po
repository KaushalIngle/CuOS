"Unlike most other tools on the Internet, Tails comes for *free* as in "
"*freedom*. We are not selling your data, sending you targeted advertising, "
"nor will ever sell our project to a big company. We give out Tails for free "
"simply because everybody deserves to be protected from surveillance and "
"censorship. But also because being free software is a necessary requirement "
"for our tools to be safe, and protect you as intended. If our source code "
"was closed, there would be no way of actually verifying that our software is "
"trustworthy."

"We often hear complaints about the fact that many software projects that are "
"meant to fight surveillance, like Tor and Tails, get a lot of funding from "
"the US government whose own surveillance projects are severely criticized. "
"We completely share this concern and we will worry about our accountability "
"and sustainability as long as the survival of our project depends on a few "
"small grants, some of them coming from organizations linked to governments."

"From anonymized statistics on our website we know that Tails is used by "
"around 18 000 people every day. **If each of them gave 12€, the price of a "
"USB stick, our budget for the whole year would be raised within one day.** "
"As you can see, funding Tails through donations is a realistic and our "
"budget ridiculously small compared to the multibillionaire companies and "
"agencies running the surveillance business."

"But many of our users could actually get in trouble if they donated to an "

"alive. Please consider setting up a yearly or monthly donation."
