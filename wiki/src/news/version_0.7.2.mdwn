The Amnesic Incognito Live System, version 0.7.2, is out.

This is a bugfix-only release mainly aimed at fixing serious security
issues in bundled software. All users must upgrade as soon as
possible.

# Changes

Notable user-visible changes include:

* Iceweasel
  - Disable Torbutton's external application launch warning.
    ... which advises using Tails. Tails *is* running Tails.
  - FoxyProxy: install from Debian instead of the older one we previously
    shipped.

* Software
  - Upgrade Linux kernel to Debian's 2.6.32-34squeeze1: fixes tons of
    bugs, closes a few security holes as well.
  - haveged: install an official Debian backport instead of a custom backport.
  - unrar: install the version from Debian's non-free repository.
    Users report unrar-free does not work well enough.

Plus the usual bunch of minor bug reports and improvements.

See the online
Changelog
for technical details.
