Infrastructure
==============

  ([[!tails_gitlab tails/sysadmin/-/issues/17740]])

  Tails images in our CI ([[!tails_gitlab tails/sysadmin/-/issues/17731]])

Funding
=======

### Grants

- Our application to [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net/publications/news/announcements/ripe-ncc-community-project-fund-2020-recipients-announced)
  on improving Tails for censorship circumvention was approved.

- Our applications to Prototype Fund in March and Code Lutins were rejected.

### Donation process

- We analyzed the results of the A/B testing on the new display of "one- time"
  and "monthly".

  The new version leads to more donation attempts AND less cancellations in the
  attempt. The new version is live on the website for everybody now.

### Donation campaign

- We launched the donation campaign!

- We started a database of problems reported by donors, as a way of
  gathering data whenever we will want to improve on the most pressing
  issues.

- The only metrics that we can gather right now is donations in
  cryptocurrencies.

  So far we've had +62% donations in Bitcoin (266, 6.9k€) and +205%
  donations in Monero (156, 2.2k€).

Translations
============

- We improved the staging website build process.

- We changed the maintainers email contact from tails-translations@boum.org to
  tails-weblate@boum.org, to prevent confusion on matters related to
  translations. ([[!tails_ticket 17734]]
