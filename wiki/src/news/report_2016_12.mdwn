Releases
========

* Tails 2.9 was cancelled due to
  [CVE-2016-1252](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1252).
* [[Tails 2.9.1 was released on December 14|news/version_2.9.1]] (minor release).
* Tails 2.10 is [[scheduled for January 24|contribute/calendar]].

The following changes were introduced in Tails 2.9.1:

* Switch to *DuckDuckGo* as the default search engine in *Tor Browser*.
  The previous default search engine, *Disconnect.me*, has already been
  redirecting to *Duck Duck Go* for some time.

Code
====

* We've had a great sprint about porting Tails to Debian Stretch.
  Most of our time was spent integrating the new Greeter as well as bug fixing,
  polishing, and updating the test suite:
  report from the sprint.
  Our goal is to publish a first beta version based on Debian Stretch at
  the end of January.

* intrigeri made sure that a number of packages we care about are in
  good shape for Debian Stretch, that will be frozen very soon.

* We [[!tails_ticket 11799 desc="wrote manual tests for the Installation
  Assistant"]], so we can spot any problems with it before we release new
  Tails versions.

Infrastructure
==============

* 387 ISO images were automatically built and tested by our continuous
  integration infrastructure.

* We deployed a clone of our Jenkins setup for building and testing
  ISO images automatically, and improved the corresponding Puppet code
  to make it possible. This should make it easier for new
  [[system administrators|contribute/how/sysadmin]] to join us.
