On October 12, we started our [[yearly donation campaign|news/2018-fundraiser]].
Today, we summarize what we achieved with your help in 2018 and
renew our call for donations.

New features
============

- We integrated *VeraCrypt* in the desktop to allow you to work with
  encrypted files across different operating systems (Windows, Linux,
  and macOS).

  This work was done upstream in GNOME and will be available outside of
  Tails in Debian 10 (Buster) and Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish).

- *[[Additional Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]]* allows
  you to install additional software automatically when starting Tails.

  [[!img doc/first_steps/additional_software/additional-software.png link="no" alt=""]]

- We added a [[screen locker|doc/first_steps/desktop#screen-locker]]
  to give you some protection if you leave your Tails unattended, willingly or
  not.

- We completely redesigned our [[download page|install/download]] and
  verification extension to make it easier to get and verify Tails. It
  is also now possible to verify Tails from Chrome.

Adoption
========

- Tails was used approximately 22 000 times a day.

- We did more usability work than ever before. Every new feature was
  tested with actual users to make sure Tails becomes easier to use.

- We answered 1123 bug reports through our help desk and helped all these people to
  be safer online.

Under the hood
==============

- We released 11 new versions of Tails to continue offering improvements
  and security fixes as soon as possible, including 4 emergency
  releases. This year we've faced critical security issues like Spectre,
  Meltdown, EFAIL, and issues in Firefox and are working hard to always
  have your back covered!

- We made the build of Tails completely
  [[reproducible|news/reproducible_Tails]], which brings even more trust
  in the ISO images that we are distributing, a faster release process,
  and slightly smaller upgrades.

- We greatly diversified our sources of income. Thanks to all of you,
  the share of donations that we got from individuals increased from 17%
  to 34%. This made our organization more robust and independent.

Community
=========

- We published a [[social contract|news/social_contract]] to clarify the
  social commitments that we stand by as Tails contributors.

- We attended 12 conferences and connected to free software and Internet
  freedom communities in 8 different countries, including Chaos Computer
  Congress (Germany), FOSDEM (Belgium), Internet Freedom Festival
  (Spain), Tor Meeting (Italy and Mexico), Debian Conference (Taiwan),
  and CryptoRave (Brazil).

- We grew our pool of regular contractors with 4 new workers, mostly to
  work on our core code and infrastructure. These include several very
  skilled Debian developers.

All of this is made possible by donations from people like you. And because
they help us to plan our work, we particularly appreciate monthly and yearly donations,
even the smallest ones.

If you liked our work in 2018, please take a minute to donate and
make us thrive in 2019!
