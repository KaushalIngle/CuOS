Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.15 was released on July 9th|news/version_3.15]] (bugfix release).

* Tails 3.16 is [[scheduled for September 3rd|contribute/calendar]].


Documentation and website
=========================

- We updated most of our documentation to Tails based on Debian 10
  (Buster). ([[!tails_ticket 16282]])

- We simplified and updated our description of the system requirements.
  ([[!tails_ticket 11663]] and [[!tails_ticket 16810]]).

- We fixed the display of the "Tor check" button on the homepage of *Tor
  Browser*. ([[!tails_ticket 15312]])

  This "Tor check" button is used by around 10% of users.

- We removed the "% translated" indication from our website because it was
  misleading. ([[!tails_ticket 16867]])

User experience
===============

- [Odile Carabantes](https://studiomoare.com/) and [Enso
  Studio](https://www.ensostudio.tv/) created an animation on
  [[using the boot menu to start Tails|install/windows#animation]].

- We tested 2 alternatives to *Etcher* as it has some privacy issues
  ([[!tails_ticket 16381]]):

  - Rawrite32 ([[!tails_ticket 16553]])
  - Win32 Disk Images ([[!tails_ticket 14447]])

- We proposed some small improvements to adjust *Tails Installer* to the
  fact that we are now distributing USB images:

  - Rename *Tails Installer* as *Tails Cloner* ([[!tails_ticket 16907]])
  - Use USB images instead of ISO images in *Tails Installer* ([[!tails_ticket 16906]])

- We proposed a design to use *Tails Installer* to backup the
  persistent volume.

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Many people are still having graphic card problems, specially [[!tails_ticket 16815 desc="#16815 Error starting GDM with [AMD/ATI] Carrizo"]].

1. We got a lot of support requests about **'Tails not being able to delete images'**. After a while we realised it was because of a confusing part of our documentation. We will try to fix that soon: [[!tails_ticket 16975 desc="#16975 Users get confused at our documentation and think Tails does not delete images at all"]].

1. Users keep trying to use Electrum even when, at the moment, it is not easy in Tails.

Infrastructure
==============

- We finished fixing the description of the mechanism for the
  [[revocation of the Tails signing
  key|doc/about/openpgp_keys/signing_key_revocation]] after an external
  review. ([[!tails_ticket 15604]])

- We discussed additions of new people to the Tails signing key
  revocation mechanism. ([[!tails_ticket 16665]])

- The new backups system for our entire infrastructure is live.
  ([[!tails_ticket 15071]])

- We upgraded our Puppet master (sic) to Debian 10 (Buster), which
  supports PuppetDB out of the box. This allowed us to drop a bunch of
  hackish workarounds and it was a great way to fast-track the
  onboarding of zen, our new sysadmin. ([[!tails_ticket 16460]])

- We made great progress on our [web translation
  platform](https://translate.tails.boum.org/):
  - We fixed a number of bugs identified since we submitted the platform
    to a production workload.
  - We modified in depth the permissions model to address issues identified
    by a security review.
  - We sent a public call for testing.
  - We kept working on documentation for translators.
  - We adjusted the resources allocated to the VM that runs this platform
    and deployed Apache `mod_security` to make it a bit less scary.

Funding
=======

- Our proposal to the [Mozilla Open Source Support](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/)
  was accepted. It will fund our work to:

  - Improve Upgrades, late 2019 and early 2020 ([[!tails_ticket 8415]] and [[!tails_ticket 15281]])
  - Support Secure Boot, mid 2020 ([[!tails_ticket 6560]])
  - Migrate to GitLab, early 2020 ([[!tails_ticket 15878]])

On-going discussions
