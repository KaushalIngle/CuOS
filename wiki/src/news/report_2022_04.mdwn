- Disoj, our new Project Manager, started working with us.

  It's the first time Tails has a dedicated Project Manager and we are all very
  excited about this change. Disoj will help us work better and faster to
  accomplish our [[mission|contribute/mission]].

- We got very busy preparing [[Tails 5.0|news/version_5.0]].

- We upgraded all our infrastructure to Debian 11 to ensures that all our
  public and internal servers will continue receiving security updates timely
  after August.

- We organized 2 [[online trainings|news/ciclo_de_autodefensa_digital_mexico]]
  for people in Mexico.

  You can download our
  [[slides|contribute/how/promote/material/slides/Ciclo_Autodefensa_Digital_202204/Tails-Spanish.odp]]
  and the
  [[structure|contribute/how/promote/material/slides/Ciclo_Autodefensa_Digital_202204/structure]]
  of the training if you want to organize Tails workshops yourself.

- Tails has been started more than 783&#8239;850 times this month. This makes
  25&#8239;031 boots a day on average.
