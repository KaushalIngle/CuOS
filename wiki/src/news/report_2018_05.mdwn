Releases
========

* [[Tails 3.7 was released on May 9|news/version_3.7]] (minor release).

* Tails 3.8 is [[scheduled for June 26th|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

* We released a [[Beta version of Tails to test the Additional software feature GUI|news/test_asp-beta/]].

Documentation and website
=========================

- We wrote a FAQ about why we don't provide a checksum to verify Tails
  downloads.

- We merged the former /install/os into [[/install|install]] to
  streamline a bit more our installation instructions.

- We changed the style of the purple headers that we had on our homepage
  to look less like buttons. We're now consistently using green for
  clickable elements and purple for non-clickable elements.

- We improved the display of command line examples
  in our installation instructions for macOS.

- We published some first items of a [[documentation style
  guide|contribute/how/documentation/style_guide]].

User experience
===============

- We did some moderated user testing of the Additional Software
  beta.

- We wrote a scope of work together with [Simply
  Secure](https://simplysecure.org/) to work on explaining what it
  Tails and got it approved by the OTF usability lab. ([[!tails_ticket 9814]])
  It covers:

  - Defining brand attributes for Tails
  - Writing a new tagline
  - Structuring an explanation of the main properties of Tails
  - Ideating on visuals to support the explanation of Tails
  - Reviewing our current introductory pages and proposing more
    approachable copy samples and tone guidelines

- We started reviewing collectively the persona skeletons that were
  defined last August. We started with Kim, the surveilled at
  home.

- We documented some resources that we use for [[user
  testing|contribute/how/user_experience#resources]].

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

Help desk has seen the same issues than last month:

1. Users are still affected by [[a loss of
   persistence.conf|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10976]]

1. We received also several reports about [[keyboard and mouse not
   working after upgrading|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/14754]]

1. A few users reported the [[disappearance of a part of their
   keyring|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15014]]

1. And some users had [[trouble with obfs4
   bridges|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15548]]

Infrastructure
==============

- We continued working on the integration of the translation platform with our infrastructure [[!tails_ticket 10034]].

- With the help of our mirror operators we've started to remove rsync.torproject.org from the mirrors synchronization chain [[!tails_ticket 15162]].

- We started working on hosting our website ourselves
  ([[!tails_ticket 14588]]): we've identified potential issues,
  evaluated corresponding solutions, designed a migration plan and
  started working on it.

- We made progress on having our automated test suite run on current
  Debian testing/sid but hit a new, major and concerning blocking
  issue regarding the state of SikuliX in Debian
  ([[!tails_ticket 15460]], [[!debbug 897215]], [[!debbug 897333]]).
  We could definitely use help from Debian package maintainers; bonus
  points if you know anything about packaging Java code!

Funding
=======

- The proposal that we sent to NLnet on distributing USB
  images was rejected.
