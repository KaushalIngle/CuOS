This release is an emergency release to fix security vulnerabilities in *Tor
Browser* and *Tor*.

You should upgrade as soon as possible.

[[!toc levels=1]]

## Included software

- Update *Tor Browser* to [9.0.7](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-907), which 
  prevents [[JavaScript from sometimes being enabled in the *Safest* security
  level of Tor Browser|news/javascript_sometimes_enabled_in_safest]].

- Update *Tor* to [0.4.2.7](https://blog.torproject.org/new-releases-03510-0419-0427),
  which fixes TROVE-2020-002, a major denial-of-service vulnerability that
  affects both Tor relays and clients. Using this vulnerability, an attacker
  could cause Tor to consume a huge amount of CPU, disrupting its operations
  for several seconds or minutes, and create patterns that could aid in traffic
  analysis.

- Update *Thunderbird* to [68.6.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/68.6.0/releasenotes/).
