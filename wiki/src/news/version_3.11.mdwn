  graphics cards.

  options|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]].

  If this workaround doesn't work, add `nomodeset xorg-driver=vesa` to
  the [[startup options|doc/advanced_topics/boot_options]].

  If this workaround doesn't work, please report to
  <tails-support-private@boum.org>:

  - The brand and model of your computer.
  - The workaround that you tried and that failed.
  - If possible, the output of the `lspci -n` command executed
    on another Linux system, such as an older Tails.
