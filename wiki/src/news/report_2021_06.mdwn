Highlights
==========

- We entirely rewrote and redesigned our [very old warnings
  page](https://web.archive.org/web/20210531191605/https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/).

  The [[new warnings page|doc/about/warnings]] is shorter, easier to understand
  by less technical people, less scary, more helpful, and visually attractive.
  We also integrated it in our [[download page|install/download]] so that
  people can learn more about tails while waiting for their download.

  Read our articles on:

  - [[Protecting your identity|doc/about/warnings/identity]]
  - [[Limiations of Tor|doc/about/warnings/tor]]
  - [[Using untrusted computers|doc/about/warnings/computer]]

- We finished making Tails ready for the deprecation of onion services v2 by
  upgrading to OnionShare 2.2.

- We explained that users can [[reduce the size of the
  download|doc/upgrade#reduce]] of future automatic upgrades by doing a manual
  upgrade to the latest version.

- We published our [[finances for 2020|doc/about/finances#2020]].

- We documented better [[MAT and metadata|doc/sensitive_documents/metadata]].

- We documented how to use [[Dino in Tails|doc/advanced_topics/dino]].

  Dino is being considered as an option to replace Pidgin in Tails.
