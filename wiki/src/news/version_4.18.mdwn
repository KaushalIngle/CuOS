This release fixes known security vulnerabilities.
You should upgrade as soon as possible.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Remove "Synchronizing the system's clock" notification when connecting to Tor network

  We removed this notification because it didn't recommend a specific action for
  users to take and it was unclear. It might have given users the impression
  that they should alter their UTC clock settings. ([[!tails_ticket 7439]])

  [[!img version_4.18/time-sync.png link="no"]]

- Remove Poedit

  We now use Weblate to provide translated text for Tails and the Tails website,
  so Poedit isn't as necessary. To install Poedit in Tails, see our guide on
  [[Additional Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]] ([[!tails_ticket 18236]])

- Update *Tor Browser* to [10.0.16](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-10016).

- Update *Thunderbird* to [78.9.0-1](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/78.9.1/releasenotes/).

- Update some Intel and Linux firmware packages. This should improve support for newer
hardware (graphics, Wi-Fi, and so on).

<h1 id="upgrades">Fixed problems</h1>

- Use more reliable Debian repositories

  Tails now connects to the APT repositories of Debian using their HTTPS address instead of their .onion address, for increased reliability with
  the [[Additional Software|doc/first_steps/additional_software]] feature.
  We left other Tails and Tor Project APT onion sources as is. ([[!tails_ticket 17993]])

- Display an error message when the Upgrader fails to download the signing key.
  This has been a silent error since 4.14. ([[!tails_ticket 18238]])

For more details, read our [[!tails_gitweb debian/changelog desc="changelog"]].
