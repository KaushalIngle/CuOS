We have refactored our [installation](/install/) documentation!
This is one of the results of user research we are doing ([[!tails_ticket 18074]]).
We believe this will make installation easier, encourage more people to verify Tails image, and improve the
SEO of it. You can read all the details on [[!tails_ticket 16808]].

We're actively working on releasing Tails 5, based on Debian Bullseye, soon.

Mexico](/news/ciclo_de_autodefensa_digital_mexico/) and [in
Brazil](/news/ciclo_de_autodefensa_digital_brasil/).
