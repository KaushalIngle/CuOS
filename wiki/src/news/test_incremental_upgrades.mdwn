You can help Tails! [[Incremental
upgrades|contribute/design/upgrades]] are ready for
testing. This feature allows you to upgrade a running Tails without
downloading an ISO, without burning a DVD, and without a second USB
stick or SD card. Please try it and see if all works for you.

If you have security auditing skills, you are more than welcome to
review our [[design|contribute/design/upgrades]] and
[[code|contribute/design/upgrades#code]].

# How to test incremental upgrades?

These instructions allow you to incrementally upgrade from Tails
0.22~rc1 or 0.22~rc2 to Tails 0.22 final.

**Keep in mind that this is the first broad call for testing of Tails
incremental upgrades**. It might have undiscovered issues.

Below, we assume that you have installed [[Tails
0.22~rc1|news/test_0.22-rc1]] **with <span class="application">Tails
Installer</span>** onto a USB stick or SD card.

If you have applied the incremental upgrade to Tails 0.22~rc2, skip to
[[the instructions for RC2
users|news/test_incremental_upgrades#from-rc1-or-rc2]]. Else, read on.

## From Tails 0.22~rc1

These steps allow you to incrementally upgrade from Tails 0.22~rc1 to
Tails 0.22.

1. Start Tails 0.22~rc1 and [[set an administration
   password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

1. Run this command in a <span class="application">Root
   Terminal</span> to correct the firewall:

       sed -i -e \
          's/tails-iuk-get-target-file/(tails-iuk-get-target-file tails-upgrade-frontend)/' \
          /etc/ferm/ferm.conf && \
       /usr/sbin/ferm /etc/ferm/ferm.conf

1. Follow the [[next
   steps|news/test_incremental_upgrades#from-rc1-or-rc2]].
