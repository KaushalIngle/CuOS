[[!toggle id="mac" text="Read our instructions on how to authorize

  <!-- Section copied from https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208198 -->

  <li><p>Turn on your Mac, then press and hold <strong>Command(⌘)+R</strong>
  immediately after you see the Apple logo. Your Mac starts up from
  <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201314">macOS Recovery</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p>When you see the macOS <em>Utilities</em> window, choose
  <strong>Utilities&nbsp;▸ Startup Security Utility</strong> from the menu
  bar.</p></li>

  <li><p>When you are asked to authenticate, click <strong>Enter macOS
  Password</strong>, then choose an administrator account and enter its
  password.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>[[!img startup-security-utility.png link="no" alt="Startup Security Utility"]]</p>

<p>In the <em>Startup Security Utility</em>:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>Choose <strong>No Security</strong> in the <strong>Secure
  Boot</strong> section.</p></li>

  <li><p>Choose <strong>Allow booting from external media</strong> in the
  <strong>External Boot</strong>.</p></li>

</ul>

<div class="tip">

<p>To still protect your Mac from starting on untrusted external media, you
can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455">set a firmware password</a>, available on macOS Mountain Lion or later. A
firmware password prevents users who do not have the password from starting
up from any media other than the designated startup disk.</p>

<p><strong>If you forget your firmware password it will require an in-person
service appointment with an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service
Provider.</strong></p>
