This release fixes [[many security
vulnerabilities|security/Numerous_security_holes_in_4.12]]. You should upgrade as soon as possible.

[[!toc levels=1]]

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Update *Tor Browser* to [10.0.5](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1005).

  *Tor Browser* 10.0.5 fixes the [[critical vulnerability discovered last week
  in the JavaScript engine|security/mcallgetproperty]].

- Update *Thunderbird* from 68.12 to [78.4.2](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/78.4.2/releasenotes/).

  *Thunderbird* 78 replaces the *Enigmail* extension with built-in support for
  OpenPGP encryption.

  If you used *Enigmail* before Tails 4.13, follow our [[instructions to
  migrate from *Enigmail* to *Thunderbird*
  78|doc/anonymous_internet/thunderbird/openpgp_migration]].

- Add a button to restart Tails at the end of creating the Persistent Storage.
  ([[!tails_ticket 16384]])

- Only include translations for languages that are available in the Welcome
  Screen. This reduces the size of the download by 5%. ([[!tails_ticket 17139]])

- Make the root directory of the Persistent Storage only readable by the `root`
  user. ([[!tails_ticket 7465]])

  Users of the Dotfiles feature of the Persistent Storage can choose
  **Places&nbsp;â–¸ Dotfiles** to open the
  */live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles folder* in the *Files*
  browser.

- Enable TCP timestamps. This might increase stability on slower Internet
  connections. ([[!tails_ticket 17491]])

<h1 id="fixes">Fixed problems</h1>

- Fix the **Upgrade** button of *Tails Installer* when running Croatian,
  Danish, French, Hebrew, Macedonian, Simplified Chinese, and Turkish.
  ([[!tails_ticket 17982]])

- Allow raising the sound volume above 100%. ([[!tails_ticket 17322]])
