We plan to release Tails 5.0 on May 3 or May 31. It will be the first version of Tails
based on DebianÂ 11 (Bullseye). It brings new versions of most of the software
included in Tails and some important usability improvements.

You can help Tails by testing the beta for Tails 5.0
before the end of April.
