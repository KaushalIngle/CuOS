Press and testimonials
======================

* 2013-10-15: [CRYPTO-GRAM, October 15,
  2013](http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-1310.html) —
  Bruce Schneier: "One thing I didn't do, although it's worth considering, is
  use a stateless operating system like Tails. You can configure Tails with a
  persistent volume to save your data, but no operating system changes are ever
  saved. Booting Tails from a read-only DVD -- you can keep your data on an
  encrypted USB stick -- is even more secure. Of course, this is not foolproof,
  but it greatly reduces the potential avenues for attack."
