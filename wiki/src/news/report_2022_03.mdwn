We've been working hard on the upgrade of Tails to Debian 11
Bullseye. You can [[test Tails 5.0~beta1|news/test_5.0-beta1]] and
[[!tails_gitlab groups/tails/-/milestones/20#tab-issues desc="track
the progress"]] of our work.

Online trainings in [[Mexico|news/ciclo_de_autodefensa_digital_mexico/]] and
[[Brazil|news/ciclo_de_autodefensa_digital_brasil/]] were prepared and
conducted. You can check out [the nice
slides](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/promote/material/slides/Ciclo_Autodefensa_Digital_202204/Tails-Spanish.odp)
that were used.

We [[interviewed Daniel
Mo√übrucker|contribute/how/user_experience/interviews/daniel/]], who used Tails
to investigate pedocriminal forums on the Darknet and took down 13.5 terabytes
of photos and videos of child abuse.

Our page about [[trusting Tails|doc/about/trust/]] was entirely rewritten and
we have a new [[FAQ about VoIP|support/faq/#voip]].
