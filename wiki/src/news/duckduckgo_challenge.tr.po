"provides anonymity out-of-the-box. With Tails, you can use the Internet "
"anonymously and circumvent censorship. You'll be in control about the traces "
"you want to leave and those that you'd rather see forgotten.  Installed onto "
"a USB key, Tails discreetly fits into your pocket."

"helps diverse people around the world to be safe online every day. But we "
"think that the immense work we've done until now should have an even bigger "
