We're sorry it took us so long to publish this report. We'll publish
fresher news soon :)

The 16th of August was Tails 6th birthday. Well, Tails existed before, but it was the birthday of [the first public release](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2009-August/002667.html). Actually, it was named amnesia then, it was before the fusion with Incognito.

Never mind the details. Let's celebrate!

Releases
========

* [[Tails 1.5 was released on August 11, 2015|news/version_1.5]] (major release).

* [[Tails 1.5.1 was released on August 28, 2015|news/version_1.5.1]] (minor emergency release to update Tor Browser to 5.0.2).

The following changes were introduced in Tails 1.5:

  - **Disable access to the local network** in the *Tor Browser*. You
    should now use the *Unsafe Browser* to access the local network.
  - Install *Tor Browser* 5.0 (based on Firefox 38esr).
  - Install a *32-bit GRUB EFI boot loader*. Tails should now start on
    some tablets with Intel Bay Trail processors among others.
  - Let the user know when *Tails Installer* has rejected a device
    because it is too small.

Documentation and website
=========================

* We finally found a good formulation about Tails not protecting against BIOS malware.

* We documented [[the languages in which user support is available|support]].

* We reorganized information between the Start Tails and the Tails does not start pages.

* We published an (incomplete) list of organizations doing Tails training.

* We documented how to workaround issues on [[switchable graphics computer|support/known_issues#switchable_graphics]].

* We explained better why we disabled the [[circuit view of Tor
  Browser|doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#torbutton]] in Tails.

* We explained why Tails had [[no antivirus software|support/faq#antivirus]].

* We explained how to analyse [[Wi-Fi problems with Broadcom interfaces|support/known_issues#wireless]].

User experience
===============

- On the Download and Verify extension for Firefox:
  * sajolida sent an email to give the status of our work.
  * Giorgio Maone explained the changes in the landscape of Firefox extensions and how they affect the technology that we can use.
  * Clarified what happens in case of an interrupted download](https://labs.riseup.net/code/attachments/download/924/extension-20150828-resume.png).

- On the Installation Assistant:
  * We [[!tails_ticket 10047 desc="took decisions"]] from the testing of the
    Windows installation scenario that was tested in June.

Infrastructure
==============

* We asked our mirrors to disable HTTP ETag to better support resumed
  downloads and documented how to do that.

* Despite of the [Tor bug](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11741)
  limiting our pool of HTTP mirrors is getting small. We need mirrors again and
  [[stopped saying that our pool is full|contribute/how/mirror#http]].

* Our test suite covers 191 scenarios, 6 more than in July.

Funding
=======

* We finally signed a contract with OTF, running from February 2015 to July
  2016, and sent our first report.

* We created ourselves a [Flattr account](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=tails_live&url=https://tails.boum.org&title=Tails).

Outreach
========

* [We have Tails stickers again](http://t.co/AgtuTN0XmJ)! We'll share them during upcoming events, you can also [[make your own|contribute/how/promote/material/stickers]].

* Alan attended [GUADEC, the GNOME conference](https://2015.guadec.org/) in Gothenburg, Sweden on August 7 – 9  and connected us better with the GNOME community.

* A talk about Tails took place during DebConf15 in Heidelberg, Germany, on August 15th.

* DrWhax did a lightning talk about Tails at [CCCamp](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/wiki/Main_Page) on August 13 - 17 in Zehdenick, Germany.

On-going discussions
====================

* Alan submitted for review a new version of
  Tor Monitor
  (to replace Vidalia) and Sascha Steinbiss proposed to
  package it for Debian.

* We drafted a script to [[!tails_ticket 9993 desc="run a Mumble server"]] from
  Tails, verified that the Mumble client in Tails Jessie works well, and
  started using it for internal meetings.
