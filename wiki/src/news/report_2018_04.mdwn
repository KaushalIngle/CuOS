Releases
========

There have been no releases in April (a big change compared to the three
releases in March!).

* Tails 3.7 is [[scheduled for May 8|contribute/calendar]].

Code
====

* We kept working with upstream to be able to [support VeraCrypt in
  GNOME](https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks/pull/495).

* [MAT2](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2) is being developed. Lots of
  improvements, will come with support for new formats (torrents!) and
  more.

* We worked on the new Additional Software
  feature, that will be
  ready for Tails 3.9 and will make programs easy to install each time
  you start Tails (as long as they are available from
  [[Debian|support/faq/#software]]).

Documentation and website
=========================

- We wrote a new page to list [[known issues with graphics
  cards|support/known_issues/graphics]]. Combined with the better error message
  when GDM fails to start that we introduced in [[Tails 3.6|news/version_3.6]],
  it should gradually improve a lot the experience of people who cannot start
  Tails with their graphics card.

User experience
===============

- We started designing a quantitative survey of our user
  base.

  What would be useful for us to know about our users?

- We drafted a fourth persona skeleton.

- We removed the zooming effect on the screenshots in our installation
  instructions which was annoying. ([[!tails_ticket 14678]])

Hot topics on our help desk
===========================

1. Users are still affected by [[a loss of
   persistence.conf|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/10976]]

1. We received also several reports about [[keyboard and mouse not
   working after upgrading|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/14754]]

1. A few users reported the [[disappearance of a part of their
   keyring|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15014]]

1. And some users had [[trouble with obfs4
   bridges|https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/15548]]

Infrastructure
==============

- We documented our [[LimeSurvey
  installation|contribute/how/user_experience/limesurvey]].

# Funding

- We participated in the DuckDuckGo Privacy Challenge. We raised
  $9&thinsp;870 in donations and will receive $33&thinsp;000 in prizes
  from DuckDuckGo.

  Thanks a lot to everybody who participated!

<!-- I'm not reporting on USB images on purpose: let's announce it once it's 100% confirmed. -->

- The italian association "Mutuo Soccorso", in their last book "Stop al Panico!
  Difesa legale, note per una maggiore consapevolezza", "Don't Panic!Legal
  defense, notes for greater awareness" - Bologna march 2018, suggests use
  Tails (p 132) for high needs of anonimity, to circumvent the
  censorships, or to manage in an easy way confidential communications.
