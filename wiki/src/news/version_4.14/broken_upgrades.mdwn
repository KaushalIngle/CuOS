* Automatic upgrades are broken from Tails 4.14 and earlier.

  To upgrade from Tails 4.14 or earlier, you can either:

  - Do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade#manual]].

  - Fix the automatic upgrade from a terminal. To do so:

    1. Start Tails and set up an
       [[administration password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

    1. In a terminal, execute the following command:

           torsocks curl --silent https://tails.boum.org/isrg-root-x1-cross-signed.pem \
           | sudo tee --append /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/tails.boum.org-CA.pem \
           && systemctl --user restart tails-upgrade-frontend

       <div class="note">

       <p>This command is a single command that wraps across several lines.
       Copy and paste the entire block at once and make sure that it executes
       as a single command.</p>

       </div>

    1. Approximately 30 seconds later, you should be prompted to upgrade to the latest
       version of Tails. If no prompt appears, you might already be running the
       latest version of Tails.
