# Known issues

- Debug and error messages appear when starting Tails, including an
  alarming message about a *kernel BUG*.

  These messages do not affect the safety of Tails.

  [[!img logs.png link="no"]]

- In *Tails Installer*, it is only possible to select an ISO image when
  choose **Use a downloaded Tails ISO image** when running Tails in
  English. For other language, the file chooser button remains inactive:

- The documentation shipped in Tails doesn't open in *Tor Browser*
  anymore. The warning page of the *Unsafe Browser* also lacks graphical
  design. ([[!tails_ticket 14962]] and [[!tor_bug 24243 desc="Tor #24243"]])
