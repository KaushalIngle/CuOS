Our services will be down for maintenance on Tuesday June 8th between 12:00 and
15:00 UTC. We'll be changing the IP address of our main server. We expect the
actual switch to be quick. However, it might take some time for everything to
be back up and running while the changes to our DNS records propagate.

During that period, our website will be offline and Tails upgrades will not
work.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
