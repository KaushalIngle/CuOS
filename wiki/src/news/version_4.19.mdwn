We worked very hard last week to get ready to release the work on the
connection to Tor that we have been showing you in
[[4.19~beta1|test_4.19-beta1]] and [[4.19~rc1|test_4.19-rc1]]. We made a lot of
progress but didn't feel confident enough to release it today.

So, we are releasing 4.19 as a regular upgrade and will release this work in
4.20. We will publish an updated rc2 in the coming days with even more
improvements on the connection to Tor.

<h1 id="changes">Changes and updates</h1>

- Stop pinning the TLS certificate of our website when doing automatic
  upgrades.

  We broke automatic upgrades twice recently; once in December in
  [[4.14|news/version_4.15#broken-upgrades]] and again during a few days on
  [[!tails_ticket 18324 desc="May 15"]]. These 2 times, it was the consequence
  of a security feature: the pinning of the TLS certificate of our website when
  doing automatic upgrades.

  We removed this feature because the recent problems proved us that this
  feature was not worth it if it makes us break automatic upgrades that often.
  ([[!tails_ticket 18324]])

  Our upgrades are still as strongly authenticated as they are signed using
  OpenPGP by our team.

- Add visual feedback when typing an administration password with <span
  class="code">sudo</span> in a terminal:

      amnesia@amnesia:~$ sudo -i
      [sudo] password for amnesia: ******** 

- Update *Tor Browser* to [10.0.17](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-10017).

- Update *Thunderbird* to [78.10.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/78.10.0/releasenotes/).
