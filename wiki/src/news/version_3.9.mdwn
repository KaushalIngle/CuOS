Tails 3.9 is the biggest update of Tails this year!

It includes two new features on which we have been working for more than a year:

* *VeraCrypt* integration

This release also fixes [[many security
issues|security/Numerous_security_holes_in_3.8]] and users should
upgrade as soon as possible.

# Changes

## New features

### Additional Software

You can now install additional software automatically when starting Tails.

When installing an additional Debian package from Tails, you can decide to
install it automatically every time:

[[!img doc/first_steps/additional_software/add-additional-software.png link="no" alt="Add vlc to your additional software? 'Install Only Once' or 'Install Every Time'"]]

To check your list of additional software packages, choose
**Applications**&nbsp;▸ **System Tool**&nbsp;▸ **Additional Software**.

<div class="caution">

<p>The packages included in Tails are carefully tested for security.
Installing additional packages might break the security built in Tails, so be
careful with what you install.</p>

</div>

### VeraCrypt integration

To unlock *VeraCrypt* volume in Tails, choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **System
Tool**&nbsp;▸ **Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes**.

The integration of *VeraCrypt* in the *Files* and *Disks* utilities was done
upstream in GNOME and will be available outside of Tails in Debian 10 (Buster)
and Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish).
