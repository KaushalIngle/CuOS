# Known issues

### Electrum is outdated and cannot connect to servers

<a id="electrum-phishing"></a>

<p><strong><span class="application">Electrum</span> in Tails cannot connect
anymore to Electrum servers.</strong></p>

<p>The version of <span class="application">Electrum</span> in Tails is
vulnerable to a <a href="https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/4968">phishing
attack that tricks people in updating to a malicious version of
<span class="application">Electrum</span></a> which is not distributed from the
official Electrum website.</p>

<p><strong>You are safe unless you try to do the malicious update
manually.</strong></p>

<p>To prevent this phishing attack, all trustworthy
<span class="application">Electrum</span> servers now prevent
older versions from connecting to them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, newer versions of <span class="application">Electrum</span>
are not available in Debian and cannot be integrated easily in Tails. Given the
lack of maintenance of Electrum in Debian, we are still
<a href="http://lists.autistici.org/message/20190319.170700.b3b5bf1f.en.html">assessing
what is best to do in Tails</a>.</p>

<p>Until then, your wallet is not lost and you can restore it from its seed
using an <a href="https://electrum.org/#download">up-to-date version of
Electrum</a> outside of Tails.</p>

### Tails fails to start a second time on some computers ([[!tails_ticket 16389]])

On some computers, after installing Tails to a USB stick,
Tails starts a first time but fails to start a second time. In some
cases, only BIOS (Legacy) was affected and the USB stick was not listed
in the Boot Menu.

We are still investigating the issue, so if it happens to you, please
report your findings by email to <tails-testers@boum.org>. Mention the
model of the computer and the USB stick. This mailing
list is [archived publicly](https://lists.autistici.org/list/tails-testers.html).

To fix this issue:

1. Reinstall your USB stick using the same installation method.

1. Start Tails for the first time and [[set up an administration
   password|doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password]].

1. Choose <span class="menuchoice">
   <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
   <span class="guimenuitem">Root Terminal</span>
   </span> to open a <span class="application">Root Terminal</span>.

1. Execute the following command:

   <p class="pre command">sgdisk --recompute-chs /dev/bilibop</p>

You can also test an experimental image:

1. [Download the *.img* file from our development
   server](https://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_bugfix-16389-recompute-chs/lastSuccessful/archive/build-artifacts/).

1. Install it using the same installation methods.

   We don't provide any OpenPGP signature or other verification technique
   for this test image. Please only use it for testing.
