<h1>How to test Tails 0.21~rc1?</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Keep in mind that this is a test image.</strong> We have made sure
      that it is not broken in an obvious way, but it might still contain
      undiscovered issues.

      Test wildly!
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you find anything that is not working as it should, please [[report to
us|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]]! Bonus points if you check that it is not a
<a href="#known_issues">known issue of this release</a> or a

<h1>What's new since 0.20.1?</h1>

<ul>

<li>Security fixes</li>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Don't grant access to the Tor control port for the desktop user. Else,
	an attacker able to run arbitrary code as this user could obtain the
	public IP with a <code>get_info</code> command.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Don't allow the desktop user to directly change persistence settings.
	Else, an attacker able to run arbitrary code as this user could leverage
	this feature to gain persistent root access, as long as persistence
	is enabled.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<li>New features</li>
<ul>
	<li><p>Add a persistence preset for printing settings.</p></li>
	<li><p>Support SD card connected through a SDIO host adapter.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Minor improvements</p></li>
<ul>
	<li><p>Add a KeePassX launcher to the top GNOME panel.</p></li>
	<li><p>Exclude the version string in GnuPG's ASCII armored output.</p></li>
	<li><p>Prefer stronger ciphers (AES256,AES192,AES,CAST5) when encrypting
	data with GnuPG.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use the same custom Startpage search URL than the TBB.
	This apparently disables the new broken "family" filter.</p></li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h1><a id="known_issues"></a>Known issues in 0.21~rc1</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    Regarding the persistence settings migration: only rough notes for the
    documentation are included. A much better draft
    can
    be read online.
  </li>
  <li>
    Vidalia is not translated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Web browser windows are not resized as expected ([[!tails_ticket 6367]]).
  </li>
  <li>
    The Persistent Volume Assistant does not error out as it should when asked
    to delete an active persistent volume ([[!tails_ticket 6374]]).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All these issues have fixed pending in Git and should be fixed in Tails 0.21.</p>
