You can help Tails! The first alpha for the upcoming version 3.0 is
out. We are very excited and cannot wait to hear what you think about
it :)

[[!toc levels=1]]

# What's new in 3.0?

Tails 3.0 will be the first version of Tails based on DebianÂ 9
(Stretch). As such, it upgrades essentially all included software.

It also requires a 64-bit computer, and GNOME Shell is now configured
to use its default black theme.

Technical details of all the changes are listed in the
Changelog.

# How to test Tails 3.0~alpha1?

**Keep in mind that this is a test image.** We tested
that it is not broken in obvious ways, but it might still contain
undiscovered issues.

But test wildly!

If you find anything that is not working as it should, please report to
us <tails-testers@boum.org>.

Bonus points if you first check if it is a

Download and install
--------------------

<div class="bug">

You cannot install Tails 3.0~alpha1 from Tails 2.x. It is impossible
as well to upgrade to Tails 3.0~alpha1 from Tails 2.x. So, either
install or upgrade from a non-Tails system, or start Tails 3.0~alpha1
from DVD and then clone it to a USB stick.

</div>

To install 3.0~alpha1, follow our usual [[installation instructions|install]],
skipping the **Download and verify** step.

If you find anything that is not working as it should, please report to
us on <tails-testers@boum.org>.

Bonus points if you first check if it is a
